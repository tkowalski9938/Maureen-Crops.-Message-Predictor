trust me,5
nahhhh,3
yeah but the tron server would say otherwise,0
but im so humbleeee,3
absolutely fucking not spencer,5
i cant help it when people just give me compliments all the time uwu,3
bro,5
oh nvm,5
is this about josh or me,3
josh?,0
wait no way they think josh has an ego there lmao,3
no,0
is he not a troll,3
they give him one?,0
kinda,0
oh yeah that happens,3
josh is just smart,5
he fucks the curve,5
yeah all my friends call me dumb it keeps me in line,3
josh i dont think has much of an ego tbh,3
he should tho itd be funny,3
: D,0
he doesn't really,0
can't let him get one tho,0
at least not until 3B is over,0
i think ego is fine its how you express it,3
fourth year he can do whatever he wants,0
josh wouldnt have issues because he has messed up so many times he has learned his lessons,3
???,0
like for being able to communicate,3
idk how to word it now im too tired,3
wait what LOL,0
you werent in our english class right,3
oh,0
ms corry?,0

like really really bad,3
oh well good for josh for developing a filter,0
luka please take notes,0
yooo trueee,3

nah luka u just gotta pace yourself,3
you come on too strong,3
I'm confused,5
idk how to word it im too tired for this,3
wait do people take me seriously,5
uh,0
no,3
i think the things u say are just really extreme off the bat LOL,0
idk how to word this either,0
bro,5
I don't say many extreme things,5
you just gotta be like me,3
and extreme is subjective,5
its way more complicated,5
yeah,0
we end up fairly similar but i dont immediately go off the deep end,3
but,0
like,0
small talk and then hop into whatever you wanna talk about,0
ok,5
hold up,5
name something I said that was extreme,5
I want to know,5
like ease your way into it,0
ok but shahithya what are your political views slightly_smiling_face,3
guess,0
this is a fun game,0
big hint: my whole family works in finance :D,0
^ this was an example,3
oh,0
i thought we were actually guessing,0
No idc about politics,3
wait I can't ask someone about their political views,5
at the end of the day im sure im the only politically active person on this server LMAO,3
nuh uh no,0
i *voted*,0
whoah,3
even i didnt vote yet,3
was too young,3
I could have voted but fuck that,5
dang spencer,0
disappointed,0
yeah i didnt do my part :(,3
im whats wrong with this country :(,3
yeah don't say this in front of other people,0
damn,5
someone explain why,5
"so like generally you dont want to ""show your hand"" right",3
if you meet someone for the first time just jumping straight into it is kind of a shock for most people,3
yeah,0
i guess its kinda like a staircase,3
and politics is kinda touchy,0
like,0
yeah obviously,5
you don't ask someone who they voted for,0
^or at least you shouldn't,0
wasn't I asked that,5
well,0
I don't remember asking others who they voted for,5
"u also don't say ""fuck voting""",0
idk if that was a joke or not,0
I'm a radical!,5
so like this can kinda be my staircase right,3
when i dont know someone very well i just try to be funny,3
you're in the middle spencer,5
no you're in the middle,3
yeah,0
the only people who I vent to about my insecurities are my family and Anna,3
uh it also kinda depends ig,0
like,0
talking to spencer has caused me to lose my ego,5
spencer be like,5
"""thats too easy for us to do in our math class""",5
I just do a good job of pretending to be cool smiling_face_with_sunglasses,3
then be like,5
I have,5
no ego,5
ok but that one question was so easy,3
yeah i totally have no ego smiling_face_with_sunglasses,3
yo skull_and_crossbones,5
that's why you don't talk to anyone in your program until winter break,0
:D,0
but like find your own staircase ig,3
^^,0
like i wouldnt talk about politics with many people,3
yeah,0
neither would I,5
used to a lot more,3
depends on the person,5
but its kinda a waste at this point,3
choice of humuor is another thing ig,3
yeah,0
but also,0
like knowing your audience is important,3
because other people are not comfortable with everything,3
something that you might find funny might not be funny to others,0
yeah,0
and until you know those limits you shouldnt make potentially offensive jokes,3
like test the waters ig?,0
i dont really know a good way to give an example,3
yeah,0
but like depending on who im talking to my style of humor changes drastically,3
like i guess since you know spencer really well you can make more jokes around him than if you were just talking to me?,0
is luka still even there LOL,0
well it depends on what im comfortable with still,3
cuz im not comfortable with every type of joke lol,3
yeah,0
but like,0
luka probably has a better idea of what jokes he can make around you,0
id hope so,3
lmao,0
i think we're talking to ourselves at this point,0
i see no luka,0
luka die :(,3
omg its so late,3

BRUH,1
Another hour delay,1
Maybe should sell Air Canada stock,1
short sell air canada to spite them,2
does it make sense to simultaneously buy and short a stock,4
no?,3
you always just end up net even,3
unless your intent would be to watch the market and if there seems to be a rising trend you can hold with the stocks but you could also just not short,3
k that's what I thought,4
you might lose money on short interest too,4

It's highly theoretical,5
or is this a masturbation joke,2
No,5
I'm serious,5
Another mode of propulsion,5

No,5
Not the same,5

how do I know spencer won't steal this,5
seriously,5
I'm not ok with this,5
he’s already rich,2
Not gonna let him get more rich off the innocent middle class,5
????,3
my guy you havet he chat logs,3
it is literally impossible to steal,3
wait how do you expect to vary the charge of the system,3
@​Djesezzes,3
Isn't a lot of the math hinging on the fact that charge is not being conserved in the calculations,3
but electrical charge is definitely a conserved quantity,3
how did you even see it,5
and,5
I don't think that matters,5
wdym how did i see it,3
oh you deleted it after lmao,3
i have it downloaded cuz i was interested,3
does it not matter?,3
ok well,5
you can have it,5
the lost charges should be interacting with the system,3
don't steal pls\,5
bro you have chat logs,3
you are so dense,3
thats why you flip the magnets,5
it is impossible to steal AND i have no care to,3
thats not in the pdf,5
but you need to flip the magnets to change the fields,5
flipping magnets is about reversing it from -1 to 1,3
not both at the same time,5
but changing the charge as a sinusoidal is not possible i dont think?,3
only one ',5
like spinning a magnet?,3
sort off,5
doesn't that complicate the system by a lot,3
yes,5
thats why I said,5
highly theoretical,5
so send the full paper wtf,3
but possible,5
that is one day worth of work...,5
I don't have anything else rn,5
I'm working on it,5
but it seems like its possible,5
get in call,5

i think jasmine said smtg abt downtown,1
but idk how good of an idea that is rn with omicron and stuff,1
also,1
do u guys want to do an exam mark reval tonight,1
That'd be pretty funny,4
No we really shouldn't,4
Omicron already bigger than first wave,4
isn’t it tmrw,2
yeah only thing is seems like omicron is significantly less dangerous,1
"maybe even along the lines of the cold, but think new data needs to come out not sure",1

yessir,1
i think we should do an exam reveal call,1
that would be funny,1
hmmm,2
seeing ur mark,1
then seeing a literal zero on ur exam,1
LMAO,2
my biggest fear is that,1
we all fail every exam,2
like the mishandled the exam or smtg,1
cuz bryan and i did the maths in-person,1
like they lost it or smth?,2
yeah,1
the way they collected it makes me think that it is possible,1
tho probably unlikely,1
*hopefully*,1
@​Chopin9938 they had QR codes on it and stuff,4
The chances of them messing it up is pretty small,4
Do they even give us back the exam or just our final mark,4
just the final mark but if u want to see the exam u can book an appt or smtg,1
also when i mean mess up,1
"i mean like, lose the paper",1
so QR codes wouldnt make a difference,1
they don’t give us the exam?,2
oh ig if it’s in person,2
so what we doing 30th,2
honestly down to make a fire,4
i will not join if we're doing a fire thumbs_up,3

0 mistakes is rly hard tho,1
imagine u got ur first flat 100 in uni,1
lmfao,2
literal negative adjustment factor,1
+2 adj,2
probably true,4

i was talking about tyler lmfao,2
oh LOL,4
also probably true,4
bryan you’re lacking a little confidence i see,2
have you tried listening to future?,2
i got @​Djesezzes hooked,2
it’ll do wonders for your self-image,2
lol,1
"josh u should listen to ""suffering from success""",1
it might as well be your theme song,1
lmfao the fucking dj khaled album?,2
i love the cover,2
yeah,1
i thjink that would be funny as ur pfp,1
bruh “suffering from success” status,2
become universally hated speedrun,2
lol,1
i think thatd be pretty funny,1
but only if ppl knew u were doing that ironically,1
"acc i think itd be more funny if u werent, but probably not the kinda funny youd be after",1
i mean becoming a stuck up social outcast ironically would be based,2
especially if i tank 1B,2
truee,1
would be pretty epic funny if i do say so myself,1
@​Djesezzes @​TheSilican @​MrDoga,1

Just so smart,1
Uhh it got deleted,3
Ppl get mad at him,1
For his utmost genius,1
shit,2
The lambs always get mad at the visionaries disappointed_face,1
Pretty much everyone knows about lap at this point,3
dude when are physics marks coming ou t,5
this is ridiculous,5
I still love that they had to remove a post from the Waterloo Reddit because someone was asking if anyone had actually met him,3
What was the post,1
Was just asking if anyone had ever met lapenzer irl,3
yo holy shit,2
wait is this a joke or is he actually cracked lol,2
It’s a joke lol,3
okok,2
@​jahg901,1
Cs server mod,1

one of the eng buildings has “eng sucks” scratched into its side - if that’s not beautiful idk what is,0
Ok sarcasim I see,1

Oh,1
The more you know eh,1
ye,0
@​jahg901,1
Lapenzer started a thread abt u,1
@​Chopin9938 what server are you guys doing this on,4
yo what?,2
what’s he saying,2
this is general of the uwaterloo cs server,1
he just started it but didnt say anything in it,1
is lapezer some sort of discord legend,1
seems like everyone kinda knows who he is,1
Is it just josh faking a superiority complex,4
What's wrong with you guys,4
yeah,2
and me lying about marks,2
talk shit,2
reveal inner resentment,2
lol,1
so wonky,1
and it’s joshua harper right?,2
He is a menace,3
i said it isnt u,1
Has managed to somehow ruin his reputation long before meeting anyone irl,3
damn,2
but i mean u can play it off anyways,1
isnt lapenzer a mathphys kid?,1
wait so do they know who i am lmao,2
Yeah but we have disowned him,3
nope,1
He hangs out with CS kids to my knowledge exclusively,3
lol u cant disown him,1
Only Tom has messaged him before and Tom finds him super wack,3
he is a math phys kid through and through,1
Nah he got banned,3
f,2
Only person to be banned from our server,3
he is still in mathphys tho,1
and what exactly did he do to get bannned,1
Uhh depends on which server you’re talking about but mathphys was for being racist,3
i wanted screenshots of that,2
but they’re all gone :(,2
Tom deleted them sadly,3
L for tom,2
He might have screenshots but I’m pretty sure he’s hanging out with his gf for the week,3
turbo simp behaviour,1
also,1
how racist are we talking,1
hey tyler can you say i’m obsessed with the song “in her mouth” by “future” and i shout the lyrics randomly,2
where,1
cs,2
in tron?,1
Uhh Tom banned him immediately and Tom is the conservative,3
not in cs,1
why,2
u are implying conservatives are racists lol,1
im just curious what he siad,1
like hard r?,1
No I’m not lol,3
cuz im not trying to commit social suicide,1
but it would be me obsessed with it,2
you just have to deal with me shouting the lyrics,2
He was defending a kid who said a slur in a lecture because “he says stuff to his friends too”,3
will u come back to ther server if i do that,1
lol,2
the re-entry,2
You’d have to find the specific logs but he’s fucking crazy,3
hmm,1
i feel like i’d ruin it if i came back,2
how did this even go down,1
yeah probably,1
What even go down,3
the legend of lapenzer,1
Oh it’s self inflicted,3
do u want to hear a rly based take,1
i wanted to come back and post lapenzer racist screenshots,2
but i can’t now,2
It started by him posting gore porn kinda stuff in science servers,3
Ended with racism,3
yo???????,2
poggers,1
That’s why he’s banned elsewhere,3
You should totally message him about joining his “dungeon”,3
ok here is the take,1
He will send you an invite,3
Hf,3
"slurs should be strongly shunned and discouraged, but not illegal to use",1
also yeah,1
i heard some ppl got invited to lapenzer's free speech server,1
Wdym not illegal tho,3
"like, non-criminal",1
YEAH FREE SPEECH IS AN INTERESTING WORD LOL,3
But like if it’s strongly shunned then consequences just come naturally,3
extremely unbased and mainstreampilled,2
Law only makes the consequences official,3
well,1
and law also means punishbkle by prison,1
Not always,3
mhm exactly,1
Plenty of laws don’t lead to prison,3
ok well i mean in this case,1
Prison is for reforming but community service would be completely fine,3
Or just diversity training which is the standard in the workforce right,3
"in fact, just on principle, it should be legal",1
Wdym on principle lol,3
well,1
it's not the government's place to dictate these matters,1
Hate speech is not a protected right,3
I’m any country,3
even if effectively it might result,1
did i claim it is?,1
Or maybe some random middle eastern ones idk,3
What’s the problem with just making it a law tho,3
not the government's place,1
If you agree consequences should exist,3
Is the governments place not to represent the people,3
If the people want it then it is in their place,3
The level of government this should be enforced on is a different discussion but currently I believe it’s federal,3
the goverment is not the people,1
It’s a democracy,3
doesn't mean it's the ppl,1
The government is FOR the people,3
"again, doesnt mean it is the ppl",1
But a government for the people would act in their interests?,3
does it always,1
can it?,1
I don’t see a difference between a law and a social stigma outside of consistency in application,3
I feel like it’s more moral to not rely on cancel culture to solve our issues,3
i’m just wondering how would a law about slurs even work??,2
And to have our system set up in a way which lets even the rich be held accountable,3
Is it not in effect,3
It’s just hate speech,3
there’s hate speech yeah,2
but it’s not like you can get dinged for saying a slur to friends or smth right,2
if it’s targeted and directly impacts someone then they can come forward,2
but i don’t see how a more general law against slurs could be enforced,2
I don’t think it has to be specifically targeted by law,3
If someone feels threatened by it then your speech wouldn’t be protected,3
yeah,2
"based opinion, hate speech shouldnt be a crime",1
I think in private things around speech are different sure I’ve said that before,3
other stuff already falls under other laws,1
but that’s less of a law on slurs and more of a law on hate speech with slurs as a consequence,2
"threatening, etc,",1
I think it’s hard to always argue threatening for hate speech,3
i feel like there are ways to get around it if hate speech laws aren’t in effect though,2
like,2
“i hate jews” to a shit ton of ppl,2
then a bunch of those ppl kill jews,2
but no actual threatening took place,2
and it definitely wouldn’t be past a reasonable doubt,2
technicalities would rule,2
"what's wrong with sayinbg ""i hate jews"" to a ton of ppl",1
well if a bunch of those people kill jews,2
i would argue you’re somewhat responsible,2
acc,1
that is kinda an interesting argument,1
You’re also infringing on their rights to safety for no reason,3
Offending others can be pretty easily just agreed upon as morally wrong,3
could you say hate speech laws act as a sort of better of 2 not so goods? as in it fills the grey area that inciting of violence doesnt entail,1
"like having government come in and restrict speech no good, but overall, a necessity?",1
I guess from a point of view?,3
yeah i do,2
ideally we could pinpoint responsibility every time violence occurs as a result of someone intentional speech or instigation,2
but there are way too many ways to weasel out of laws based around that,2
i see hate speech as a solution that comes at minimal cost,2
yeah i can get behind that,1
(hate speech laws),2
that is fair,1
not hate speech lmao,2
my racist era begins,2
<:catsmirk:900583954745262171>,3
lmfao,2
so actually what we doing 30th,2
there has to be something to do besides bowling and fire right,2
both at the same time?,1
actually lol,2
Wait are we going bowling again,4
dude there HAS to be something else to do,2
Well where are we having fire,4
It's gotta be reasonably close to bowling,4
Unless we get rides,4
Honestly I'm down just to sit around a fire for a few hours,4
imagine not having had christmas yet,2
where would we have the fire?,0
are we actually doing a fire lmao unles someone has one of those firepit things in their backyard,7
OU WE CAN BAKE LMAOOO,7

this guy seems weird,5
No international students are pretty chill,3
Lap is just lap,3
Merry Christmas people!,3
No,5
:(,3
merry christmas!!,0
@​MrDoga I just thought about it,5
Do you have any idea how fucked the curve is for the physics exam,5
Class average was 50,5
But a few people got 100,5
Many got 0,5
You can't curve that shit,5
They want 10% of the class to fail,5
They haven't released the marks because they literally don't know what to do,5
they curve final grades,3
not exam grades,3
are you sure its not exam grades,5
50% of the class failed that,5
prof cummings said they expect an average of mid to high 60s,5
for this exam,5
they got low 50s,5
ye,3
so they curve final grades wdym,3
she said they will curve the exam,5
to get a 60s average at least,5
oh so they do both?,3
I asked right after the exam,5
ez pz 10%,3
broo,5
but yeah you can curve that,3
ez pz 50%...,5
the people who got 100 can just get above 100,3
thats a broken curve,5
its a higher median than 137P and they still curved that,3
how is it broken,3
is it not?,5
normally the people who scored the highes ( but not 100%) would get 100% after the curve,5
thats not possible here because people already got 100%,5
depends on the system of curving doesnt it,3
rather than say 1 person should get 100 they can just change the criteria to a 65 median,3
multiply every grade by 65/55 or smth idk,3
I got my keyboard tho so im happy,3
nice,5
Figuring out how to wire it into my computer so I can play it through my sound/mic,3
and then learn the seinfeld theme,3
this is what the bell curve would look like,5
face_with_monocle,5
and 16 <a:cz_wigglewiggle_flushed:834530441317974047>,3
yes,5
and thats,5
16%,5
tbf thats true bell curve,3
i dont think many places do that,3
usually you just add enough points so that someone gets a 100,3
and just add it to everyone's score,3
im pretty shit at math so the 65/55 might be wrong its kinda just a guess,3
but you can just multiply the scores to get the median you want as well,3
@​Djesezzes join call,3
rq,3
does it work,3
not rn,3
gonna figure it out,3
Okk,5

Bye bye good luck,5
gn,3
uwu,3
only place i could think of where we could do a fire is scarborough bluffs,1
also,1
isnt covid rly bad in ontario rn or smtg,1
i think waiting until we are all back at waterloo is probably the best option,3
wouldnt covid be bad then as well?,1
is it possible that we arent allowed to go back to res and get refund or smtg,1
possible but probably unlikely,3
and hanging out outside getting ice cream or smth is definitely fine,3
i just dont know if the timing is gonna work out to set up something thats actually safe for us to do idk,3
if someone has an idea tho im all ears,3
p sure bowling is more risky than fire cuz it's indoors,4
for fire i was thinking we could go to someone's backyard,4
let's burns down mdhs,1
drake,2
I mean,5
Nothing is illegal until you get caught,5
@​Decaf Cheesecake do you have fireplace in backyard,4
Wait @​TheSilican don't u?,1
I think fire is acc ok since it is outdoor s,1
Oh yea,4
Lol guess you guys can come over then,4
I was on the SkyTrain in Vancouver,1
And this Rando creepy guy behind me,1
Think he has some sort of mental illness,1

It's like the grt,1
Is that like a cable car,4
Oh wait lol,4
No cuz it is in the sky,1
Like elevated,1
Pretty cool,1
Anyways,1
He comes up to me,1
And asks where he can find pretty young girls,1
Uh,4
Mind u it's this like 50 year old,1
Acting all erratic,1
Probably in Waterloo CS thinking_face,4
"Low-key seemed like a rapist, but I wouldnt know",1
Pedophile?,4
He was twitching behind me and talking loudly to himself,1
Could be,4
Could be,1
Did he look homeless,4
I escaped next stop,1
Yeah,1
Took next bus?,4
It's a train,1
But yeah,1
Oh right,4
Quite the experience,1
Thank God I wasn't a girl,1
well,2
did you give him tips?,2
Yeah I told him where the nearest elementary school was,1

u have to be a real creep,1
to ask a random guy where pretty young girls are right,1
acc,1
just to ask that in general,1
like what?,1
yep,2
although it is druggie shithole vancouver so it makes sense,2

One of my uncles left because he hates blow up beds but the other stayed smh,3
Honestly so much family drama this is kinda fun,3

especially when u can see people associating with one another,2
and immediately switch their tone once ppl leave,2
I asked my aunt how’s she been and she really said “terrible i can’t stop thinking of my dead husband”,3
Like damn wtf now I feel like a villain,3
menace,2
I actually felt so awkward,3
Like what do I say lmao,3
“bet he’s not thinking of you”,2
sorry is that too far,2
Probably too far,3

maureen wants to know if bryan’s house has a jacuzzi,0
Bryan ur house doesn't exist,7
"There's no such thing as ""60 rose way""",7
It's either 62 or 64,7

actually @everyone bring a little paper/cardboard to burn if you can,4
i don't have that much at home,4
lmao,2
Um seems like I am not allowed to go anymore,1
"So uhh, darn",1
Oh noo,4
Sadge,4
damn,2
@​TheSilican where u want us to go when we get there?,2
i’m here,2
One sec,4
we’re so good,2
@​TheSilican which go train did u take back to waterloo,1
Mazda 3,4
bruh,1
This isn’t English anymore,3
it's not even true,1
It’s leaving out other axioms,3
Or not axioms but like Lemmas ig?,3
I don’t remember the word,3
hypotheses?,1
Uhh no it’s like let m be a natural number,3
It’s part of the theorem,3
lol what theorem,1
Wdym what theorem I’m asking about the word to use,3
well you generally dont call smtg a theorem if it's non-meaningful,1
"i thought this was a theorem, not some arbitrary mathematical statement",1
Isn’t the theorem that which you are setting out to prove,3
The photo is just out of context of the proof,3
wot,1
i dont understand,1
The photo is out of context it’s not a theorem lol,3
But if I’m proving something then I call that which I am proving a theorem don’t I?,3
i think the general convention is to call it a statement,1
if it isn't impactful,1
but it technically isnt wrong,1
"all theorems are statements, but usually, at least from what ive seen, theorems are particularly important propositions",1
What makes it important,3
n is an element of integers => n^2 is an element of integers  for instance typically wouldnt be called a thoemre,1
utitlity and non-trivialness?,1
Then when I get a problem I can call the problem a theorem right,3
If it makes a statement that I have to prove,3
I feel like anything that is proven can be “useful”,3
lol i mean this is like semantic whatever,1
i was just being dumb in not understanding,1
ppl should understand what you mean by that regardless,1
Yeah ok,3
what are you even working on tho?,1
getting a head start  on 135?,1
I’m not doing 135,3
i thought ur in math side,1
Not a nerd like Luka,3
lol,1
No I’m not I have to switch next year if I want to,3
ah,1
then just exploring formal logic and proofs?,1
Reading a textbook my dad has cuz I’m bored,3
Out of town for New Years,3
oh i see,1
No computer so I won’t be playing much TFT,3
lol,1
you have a phone,1
hehe,1
Bro phone TFT is so ass,3
I hate not being able to roll down,3
oof,1
Literally no one here understands what I’m saying but I might play on chrome book sometimes but that’s it,3
And if I play it’s not gonna be on main lol I won’t have enough APM to win any games,3
lol,1
stabley gaming,1
Lebensmüde time <:catsmirk:900583954745262171>,3
Cringe,2
what a beautiful house,2
yo waterloo does percent averages,2
"ive just been friend broken up with, again",1
shit,2
oh no,0
man...,1
"i don't think it's her fault, after everything that has transpired in the past",1
"but yeah, kinda stings",1
Aww,4
Well as they say,4
Third time's the charm,4
Bruh,2

yeah,1
"wait, just to be clear, this is with minha",1
not jasmine,1
Wait what,4
woah what,0
bruh,2
Is Jasmine still going on,4
i just realized i phrased things badly,1
yeah,1
lmfao,2
How can you have broken up with Minha,4
You weren't in a relationship,4
friend breakup,1
Ohh,4
Fall out,4
i didn’t know you guys were friends,0
"ok so a few months ago, i reached out to her",1
damn i got trolled,2
"bc i felt bad abt all that happened, and we were rly close before everything went in flames",1
i was gonna be so sensitive u guys shoulda seen,2
sensitive and compassionate,2
"after so much time, i thought maybe we could at least be friends",1
oh lol,1
"bryan, for the future, maybe don’t say this if tyler does actually get dumped by jasmine",2
"yeah so anyhow, we've been talking on ig abt random things for the last few months, and just now she basically said that it's uncomfy and doesn't want to be friends anymore",1
nah i think itd be funny,1
id respect that,1
lol,2
i could outdo that tbh if u give the green light,2
sure,1
awesome,2
let's see a preview,1
nah,2
with minha friend breakup,1
number 5?,1
doesn’t exactly work here,2
darn,1
"anyway, tough about the minha thing but it is what it is",2
"lol yeah, it's ok",1
Yea kinda realized I probably shouldn't have said that,4
no it's funny,1
"but seriously, this convo im havbing rn feels like a breakup",1
ok let’s make a rule here,2
If someone has a break up,4
"if something bad happens to someone and they share it here, we all make fun of them but from a place of compassion",2
Probably don't joke about it at first,4
Oh,4
Right,4
"""i genuinely hope you can look back on our friendship without regrets one day, and rather as another memory, happy or not""",1
That's good,4
At least she still wishes you the best,4
yeah,1
hit her with a “you ain’t shit” and block,2
LOL,1
old me would have legit done that,1
honestly i think i have,1
smtg along the lines,1
i deserve what has happened,1
all these memories of things i did in hs coming back...,1
Oh no,4
I hope you do fine in the next few weeks,4
"like i remember every time she would join the table and try to talk to me, id just leave",1
lol i'll be fine,1
i am fine,1
Ok,4
Relationships are probably the most complex social activity humans do,4
particularly minha related,1
what about like,2
if you’re fucking your therapist or smth,2
ig that is a form of relationship?,1
hmm,2
i mean it ticks off both boxes,2
sex and emotional transparency,2
guys the new year is in 130 minutes,2
not epic!,1
"also minha said she doesnt want me to talk to her ever again, of course in a much more polite manner than that",1
then ended it off with waving_hand,1
well,1
that is a way to end 2021,1
lol,1
time for new year!,1
hey you get to leave all this behind,2
2022 new beginning,2
True,4
‘new year new you’,0
yes ofc,1
what’s u guys new years resolutions,2
do u have one,1
or multiple,1
eh,2
To keep my new years resolution,4
honesty i kinda feel like i killed it these past few months,2
maybe a bit of fine tuning but,2
i’m happy with how i’ve been,2
which is definitely a first lmao,2
LOL,1
i mean,1
you kinda did hard smurf it,1
even like beyond academics,2
i don’t rly feel like i fucked up that bad socially,2
and i got a taste of independence and all that,2
oh damn,1
ur new year's resolution should be like,1
get in a relationship if you feel the desire of having one,1
"like, actually achieving the end result, if that is a goal that pops up",1
then you would be turbo sigma engineer,1
lmao,2
definitely not,2
why,1
Honestly,4
if maureen bails on housing,1
...,1
Being able a have a relationship,4
Is like a milestone in social development,4
i really don’t want to be that close to someone,2
yes in regression,1
i’m thriving off of just me,2
damn,1
ok slay king,1
firefirehundred_points,1
@​jahg901 that's really something you should work on,4
or,2
not,2
Mmm,4
Forever alone,4
that would be pretty sad,1
do u ever realize,1
or like think,1
"what would it feel like, if i was just told, i wont be living tmr (ie today is my last day)",1
cuz that day will come,1
and you will be dead,1
finido,1
gone,1
no experience,1
no feeling,1
nothing,1
absolute,1
nothingness,1
yeah,2
i kinda feel like,2
if that happens,2
it is what it is,2
i’m more worried about the process,2
process of death?,1
yeah like i don’t want to bleed out that would suck,2
or like suffocate,2
ah,1
wouldnt u feel bad abt all the things you've missed tho,1
eh if i can’t change the outcome i wouldn’t see a point in dwelling on it,2
i suppose that is the logical way of looking at it,1
i just feel like the ability to live and be conscious is so profoundly amazing that we need to make the most use of such an opportutnity,1
"and the fact that our lease on life will be gone one day, well, it's ok cuz we were given the opportunity and that is in itself amazing, but also should make use of it",1
"yes, plently of logical holes in my thinking",1
it just be emotional,1
There's much more to life than pure logic,4
~~a.k.a. why English Majors exist~~,4
yeah u gotta think in a way that makes u happy yk,2
this is a good philosophy to adopt when looking forward but not when looking back,2
cuz there’s nothing you can do about it once it’s over,2

bet shopify first coop,2
it’s not necessary but i’ve heard it’s best to ‘limit’ the amount of work it takes for them - so like having it in ensures that it’s a quick scan for the employer or smth?,0

honestly it might have been a fluke that i had time to make cheat sheets in 1A,2
i hope ppl don’t expect them lol,2
i mean,0
i personally feel like making the cheat sheets urself is a better way to study than reading someone else’s? but that might also just be me,0

Dr Epp is a good lecturer,4
he just rambles on so much,4
I assume theres some overlap with profs,3
but Epp and Mann are fun,3
Epp's lectures are fun,4
but i wish he would go faster,4
and Poulin is considered one of the best profs in the math department,3
at least from what other profs have spoken of him,3
uh uw flow does not say that,0
look at the reviews tho,3
actually some people really like him,0
conrad has the same problem,3
137P tanks his score,3
cuz 137P is really fucking hard,3
conrad's 136 is really hard so it tanks his score too,3
yeah all of his ‘problems’ don’t really apply to him,0
like how fast the course is LOL,0
based,3
LMFAOO,0
yeah my bad guys,2
every prof holds poulin in really high regards from who ive talked to,3
they always mention him when people say theyre in mathphys,3
yeah he seems like a chill guy,0
mann does engineering btw,3
but cringe ECE,2
^^,0
i mean true,3
but he isnt the ECE student,3
just the prof to teach the dumb people yk,3
i just know mann because people find him really funny,3
and i have him rn for 124,3
so he’s basically an elementary school teacher,2
which is the most free course of my life btw,3
124 actually gonna be the easiest shit,3
better ace,2
true,3
i think the exam will probably be hard,3
cheat,2

i mean that kinda just sounds like plugging into a formula,3
not too bad,3
I should really start working shouldn't I,5
yep,2
what courses do yoyu have,3
it's bad when i dont want to actually do physics,1
"as in, i dont want to memorize a bunch of formulas and do math",1
"i took this course to be bird, bruh",1
memorizing formulas is kinda a bird course tho,3
no,5
k,2
no it isnt,1
a bird course is like sci206,1
sorry tyler,2
your course is easy,2
man_shrugging,2
lol,1
"i just dont want to do work, just need the credit for breadth and depth",1
why are you taking all the braindead science courses,4
cuz overload,1
ooh yea fair enough,4
"also, apparently this course isnt braindead?",1
says the se kids,1
and they do physics right?,1
thinking_face thinking_face thinking_face,4
"i mean, they are se kids...",1
what course is this lol,4
but still,1
sci238,1
stfu,5
L se,2
sci238 is a joke,5
bruh,1
im not comparing it to ur physics,1
In general tyler,5
xD,5
obviously,1
bruh,1
who cares about comparing,5
"i mean, true",1
i just wanted birdiest science credit man,1
why you want easy way out,5
idk,2
238 is 117 more than 121,2
so it’s a lot harder,2
true,3
That means your calc course is pisslow,5
it's 122 btw,4
117 to 137,5
117 is phtys,3
Ff Josh accept it,5
phys 121 was 1A right,2
not calc 1,3
Calc 1 for engineering is 117,5
also my calc class was 116 L uka,2
Oh fuck,5
LOL,4
L uka,5
That's not very nice,5
goblin,2
tyler's course = engineering physics + honors physics,4
+ pure mathematics,5
idk man Phys117 is kinda insane,3
You should see phys112,5
Someone sent me their assignment question,5
probably baby food right,2
i hope you finished it in 30 seconds and sent it back,2

that’s a lot of %,2
did you pass??,2
wait what,1
I don't think,5
its 50%,5
lmao,4
stop lying,5
that means you failed,5
the course,5
yea i passed im in 124 and 122,3

billed_cap,4
they did not take 50% off your grade,5
spencer,5
stop,5

50%,5
i asked epp during the year he said i was chilling because my test marks were fine,3

spencer did you pass or not,4
if you did pass,4
what was your final mark,4

and i talked to epp,3
^^^,4
50%,5

you did not average 95 on the quizes,5
????,3
you literally told me your mark,5
when did i say i averaged 95,3
retake ENG 193,3
you said you had the highest mastering phys mark,3
i said i had the highest quiz grade,3
does not mean overall,3
I was referring,5
to average,5
that was context,5
well ofc i didnt do most of the mastering physics assignments LMAO,3
i would like to remind everyone that spencer still has not shared his final mark,2
yes we are all aware,4
wait luka have you shared your final mark,4
I've shared it with one person,5
you should share it with more people,4
sharing is caring,4
lol legit the most chaotic person ik,1
always fuelling the fire with everything. respect,1
i appreciate that,2
thumbs_up,1
i do my best,2
chaotic neutral,4
i just make a habit of not talking about my marks,3

whatd i do,3
we’ll never know,2
spoke three words today,2
get on my level,2
i'm not sure why you're so proud of that josh,4
lol,4
good job?,0
"were they ""hey"" and ""thank you""?",1
“thanks” “you too”,2
2/3,1
ill take it,1
1.75/3,2
u don’t get full credit for “thank”,2
damn,1
it rly do be like that sometimes crying_face,1
that’s a lot of symbols,2
what is this for ?,4
i learnt,1
feynman integration,1
is rly just a massive meme,1
"look at the ""pop culture"" part of the article",1
damn i'm rewatching some clips from tbbt,4
didn't realize how misogynistic it was,4
it's like bowling,0
but better,0
lmfao,2
i think mixing the idea of legit misogny and humor is dangerous,1
cuz then the word loses its meaning,1
"like if u were to call everyone racist and use the term superfluously, then it loses some weight",1
is thattoo based?,1
i think it depends on how misogyny is used to generate humour,2
is the joke meant to reinforce misogynist tropes or poke fun of them?,2
idk the clips in question but based on what i know about big bang theory i highly doubt the show is smart enough to be doing the latter,2
not in the clips i sent,4
but more or less the misogny stems from leonard howard and raj being unable to get women,4
and then they end up being kinda creepy,4
isnt that satirizing incels?,3
more or less i guess,4
that's a good way to put it,4
are they normalizing that behaviour or ridiculing it for laughs?,2
mmm mostly ridiculing it,4
although if the joke is that they’re awkward rather than creepy i still see that as normalizing creepy behaviour to an extent,2
what is an example of a joke that reinforces misogynistic tropes?,1
all that comes to mind when it comes to jokes pertaining to the topic are ironic,1
"since if it is reflected of some underlying thoughts or presups, wouldnt it just not be humorous?",1
or maybe i just dont know enough abt the landscape of jokes are there pertaining to this,1
at least that is what i think with what ik,1
4:45 to 5:35,4
idk imagine a bunch of frat dudes making jokes about how much of a slut some girl is,2
how i met your mother,7
"the entire show reinforces misogynistic tropes, and that show ended in like 2014",7
maureen have you watched tbbt,4
like honestly so many parts of tbbt hit really close to home,4
"no but ive watched clips of it and i hate it lol 
not only did the jokes age like milk and are unfunny, the laugh track is also annoying lol",7
bryan in shambles rn,2
LOL sorry bryan,7
no no it's ok,4
pretty common opinion,4
i think the hate against laugh tracks is overblown,4
i’m saying though if there was more representation for stem people in tv shows u would not be anywhere near that show,2
/shu,4
¯\_(ツ)_/¯,4
maybe,4
"its laugh tracks in general for me now, but i think its really noticable in the big bang theory when there are no funny jokes at all and laugh tracks",7
at least some shows have annoying laugh tracks but some funny jokes,7
don't watch past season 3,4
or at least season 5,4
i will agree that seasons 5-12 were really bad,4
I think laugh tracks become super noticeable if you dont laugh at the joke,3
but there are some moments that I genuinely found hilarious in seasons 1-5,4
and low key relatable,4
like this,4
the boys figure out how to turn on the lamp using the internet,4
i'm like,4
that low key sounds kinda fun,4
"honestly bryan, u should watch seinfeld",7
lol maybe,4
"i feel like if u liked moments from tbbt, u would prob like seinfeld LMAOO",7
its on netflix,7
i've only finished 2 tv shows ever lol,4
maybe my sample size is too low,4
big bang theory and what,2
is it avatar,7
lemme guess friends,2
pls say avatar or else ill kill u,7

also i'm actually pretty dumb,0
how is someone supposed to respond to it lmao,2
i feel like that might contribute to the whole imposter syndrome thing at loo tho,1
well i don't openly say it,0
"josh is like ""hi guys im dumb""",1
",help",4
"""i got 100 in lin alg""",1
probably wont sit too well,1
i don’t say i’m dumb lol,2
no i mean,1
if you did,1
well i did not get 100 in lin alg,0
so i can say it :D,0
oh,1
lol,1
pretty good bot honestly,1
cool,1
not quite sure that’s how that works,2
ah yes anything sub 100 is dumb,1
i forgot abt that rule,1
i don't think it's that good to be modest about such things,4
just be honest while trying not to look like a jerk,4
no,1
i mean i don't pretend i'm dumb and then tell people i got a good mark on smth,0
bc that's just mean skull,0
lol yea,4
if someone tells me their mark i either say 'oh same' or if it's lower i tell them what i actually got LMAO,0
oh lol,4
which usually works,0
you don't have to say i guess,4
unless ur josh but josh doesn't tell me his marks,0
no you're only supposed to say ur mark if u got higher,1
bc it is redundant :),1
oh sorry let me fix that,2
no but i have a whole 'i dumb' thing going on,0
and that's just rude skull,0
ok if i say i got a 50,1
and you got a 90,1
but like how does someone respond to the i dumb thing,2
"you say, ""you got a 50?""",1
what is the anticipated reaction,2
i don't tell someone i dumb,0
"""why are you in tron?""",1
i just don't set expectations for myself,0
so people don't expect anything of me,0
worked throughout hs :D,0
mmm if you say you got a mark that was higher than someone else's,4
but didn't have the intention to make them feel bad,4
is there any blame on you if they feel bad,4
if someone asks i will tell,2
i think it's worse if you like pretend ur dumb the whole term and then tell someone you got a higher mark than someone,0
you!,1
oh wait,1
WHAT,0
not you,1
if someone asks they are putting themself in a position to potentially be one-upped,2
i don't tell people my marks LMAO,0
i only read the first part of that,1
like there are kids that are like 'i don't study' and then they get like 100s,0
that's just mean :D,0
seems like marks are kind of like talking about your income,4
probably best not to share it,4
i should probably share my marks less,4
i feel like it is ok to share,1
as long as the group is chill,1
"eh i feel like if you're comfortable and the other people wants to know, you can share",0
just don’t take it personally,2
is my view,2
like idc that u got higher than me in math,1
like bruh,1
that is fair,4
yeah it just depends on the group,0
like my friends and i rarely talked about our marks in hs,0
there’s so much that determines what marks someone gets that it’s not a good indicator of any one trait,2
it just is what it is,2
that's true... it is the *ultimate* indicator,1
your mark directly correlates to ur self-worth yknow?,1
fearful_face,2
uh oh,0
also i suggest not running from expectations,2
running fun tho,0
get used to not meeting expectations some people have of you,2
it’s gonna happen,2
fair,0
there was this one time i was messaging someone in cs server,4
:shocked:,1
ew u sound old,0
after exam,4
we both said how it was easier than expected,4
but i think i mentioned that I might've gotten 100,4
for josh not bryan LMAO,0
what can i say i’m seasoned,2
i don't think that was a good idea,4
it was a great idea!,1
i hope it didn't make them feel bad or come off as bragging,4
"you should have topped it off with ""how could someone not got 100? like... you have eyes, you breathe, you eat??!?""",1
well i don't think people will like remember you for it,0
it was just genuinely me being excited after doing well on the exam,4
yeah and that’s fine imo,2
that exam was trivial beyond belief,1
yeah there are kids in our server that do that,0
fair enough ok,4
me,2
lol,4
lmao,2
anyone who *didn't* get 100 must've really been ...,4
jk,4
"honestly,. drop out",1
i use spoiler tags though because i’m considerate sparkles,2

wholesome,2
halfnone,4
halfnone?,1
opposite of wholesome?,0
oh,1
at least i think idk,0
yes,4
that does indeed make sense,1
my brain is just sadge,1
$(a \vee b \Rightarrow c) \wedge a \Rightarrow \lnot c$,1
isn’t it kind of annoying to have your schedule dictated by family,2
like,2
$(a \lor b \implies c) \implies a \implies \lnot c$,4
dinner now,2
wait what,4
so late,4
come downstairs and do something,2
or whatever,2
currying,1
yes,0
is disgusting,1
@​Chopin9938 why do you use \Rightarrow over \implies,4
ik that is how coq does it,1
but it is ugly,1
"like rn i feel like, i have the entire day to get work done",2
that exists?,1
instead of like i have three hours before something,2
$a \imples b$,1
yeah that's why i'm less productive at home,0
kinda aesthetic tho,4
$a \implies b$,1
bruhv,1
it's a little bit longer,4
there's also $\iff$,4
true but also ew,1
i think currying makes more sense tbh,4
like when you have,4
jao didnt explain that was going on and i was very confused on preassessment till i was told by u,1
that is how it works,1
$A\lor B \implies \lnot A \implies B$,4
exactly,1
no urgency,1
it shows that there are 2 hypothesis,4
ok ik abt iff,1
well i guess that’s a way to look at it lol,2
for me it’s like,2
if i have a long time i can get in a zone,2
$(A\lor B) \land (\lnot A) \implies B$,4
if i have like an hour i can’t get into rhythm,2
there's one big hypothesis,4
that you have to destruct,4
oh no that's partially why my sleep schedule's kinda fucked,0
idk,1
like,0
i think the second one,1
makes more sense,1
since $A \wedge B$,1
no one bothers me in the middle of the night so i get more work done skull,0
you can use \lor and \land,4
registers to be as 2 hypotheses,1
ooh,1
but then we have class at 8:30 so that kinda screws everything over,0
i think they're easier to remember than what you were using,4

economics might be,1
unfathomably boring,1
time to look at another social science credit,1
were your first few lessons how to import stuff into excel,4
no they are on,1
the defintion of economics,1
and like,1
turbo braindead stuff,1
with arbitrary definitions,1
it hasn't even been a week,4
give it at least 2-3 weeks,4
"let's call objective statements ""positive"" statements",1
"and subjective statements ""normative""",1
like bruh,1
what a stupid course,1
i rather take poly sci or smtg,1
political science?,4
yeah,1
i wanted to take econ cuz i thought it would help me financially,1
but there is no way ill be able to focus through this course,1
tyler,4
remember something that happened,4
last sem,4
regarding courses,4
no,1
what happened,1
actually not that relatable,4
:),1
actually yea,4
remember your opinion of 147,4
"""braindead""",4
maybe econ will actually be interesting,4
i mean,1
147 is braindead compared to 145,1
tis true,1
also,1
apparently econ 101 is one of the birdesit social science credits at loo,1
so ig im stuck with it,1
big sign,1
sigjh,1
sigh,1
wait but,1
why is this entire course,1
readings,1
and not a single lecture,1
oh ok not all of it,1
most of it,1
still burh,1
switch into ECON 102,4
we're learning how to import csv files into excel thumbs_up,4
with instructions that only work on the windows version of excel,4
and basically don't work for macs smiling_face_with_tear,4
well they do work,4
the buttons are just in different places which is annoying,4
lol,1
no thanks,1
i remember microeconomics being fun,2
mathy,2

i thought he said “night”,2
i think even more than review resumes,1
doing mock interviews,1
would be very beneficial,1
omg that reminds me of hs :_D,0
idk if we could hold mock interview for each other,4
i mean,1
idk if it wouldb e that accurate,1
but just being put on the spot,1
getting asked questions abt ur projects,1
is probably good practice,1
uh i mean u should probably prepare what you're gonna say,0
like key points u wanna touch on :D,0
mock interviews or not,0
i think my strategy might just be bomb the shit out of the first interview,2
and go from there,2
LMFAO,0
i mean after a certain amount of interviews you'll know what to talk about,0
at least i hope,0
let’s hope i get that many interviews lol,2
"just know how to answer "" tell me about yourself""",0
oof,2
that's a tough q :D,0
shit u right,2
lmaooo i have my hs answer memorized but that was a sucky answer,0
is the idea just to rattle off technical experience or what,2
uh i would say tie every question back to the skills/values of the company,0
including first question,0
^tell me about yourself,0
"but don't make it super obvious you know? like make it sound conversational, answer the question but also kiss the interviewer's/company's ass",0
man,2
are we more likely to be asked those kinda questions or technical questions,1
since we are first co op,1
shouldn't we be asking jasmine,4
true,2
coop expert,2
first-round select,2
ye,1
from what she told me not as many technical,0
but @​Decaf Cheesecake come help us please,0

lol,1
ive just been studying a little ML stuff cuz im rusty and im scared they r gonna ask some technical question,1
oh no so i have to make a good impression?,2
no,1
say i got 100 in lin alg,1
i would assume so,0
honestly my strategy is gonna be humble as possible,2
say “i don’t know” without shame,2
bad!,1
oh,1
yes,1
that is a wonderful idea,1
NO!,4
there are two moments in life where you can brag,4
uni apps and job interviews,4
LMFAO,0
dude i am a lowly first year,2
'sell yourself',0
i don’t want to come off as a stuck up asshole,2
not stuck up,4
but advertise yourself,4
i mean that's the whole point of an interview tho right,0
more like,4
"""confident""",4
yeah,0
nah be like,1
be honest ofc don't lie about your abilities,4
"""you are my stepping stone""",1
but you should sound like you're capable,4
like show off ur skills without seeming like a dick,0
which you are,4
well yeah sure,2
but like i’ll go about it in a humble way yk,2
mmm,4
uh,0
humble but not modest,4
if that makes sense,4
okay wait josh,0
lmao,2
oh sadge,1
^^^,4
that's the mindset flexed_biceps,4
LMFAO,0
no i screenshoted the wrong thing,1
but ig it works,1
ig interviews are the one time where you don't have to be humble LOL,0
*exactly*,4
but also,0
don't be cocky,0
well now i’m confused,2
which i doubt you'll be but just in case i'm putting that out there,0
what why,0
"okay josh how would u respond to ""tell me about your past leadership experiences""",0
you would list them i assume and then tie them to why you would be a *great fit for the company*,0
that's not being cocky,0
at least i don't think it is,0
sure but that also falls into being humble,2
does it?,0
"if you mean humble as ""not cocky"" then yes be humble",4
i’m not saying like self hating lmao,2
sure yeah i agree with bryan LOL,0
don't be modest that's all,4
"like if you got 100 in a course don't say ""i did ok""",4
yeah that's what i was gonna say,0
"say ""i did pretty well""",4
LMFAO,0
Name someone. I did better.,2
yes that's exactly how you should respond,0
i am literally the smartest and most hard working person in all of waterloo,4
“Can you make this quick? I have like ten more interviews lined up after this. Good luck.”,2
lmao,4
"""i am the most cracked""",0
lmfao,2
FACTS,4
why is it still happening,2
you should be the one interviewing them,4
"""my presence is worth at least $20k/hr""",4
hand ur interviewer an uno reverse card and then just go for it,0
rank them before they rank you,0
"""convince me why I should prefer your position over senior software engineer at Google""",4
do u guys have portfolios,2
cuz i don’t,2
mmm not really,4
i basically just have the resume,2
ig kinda,2
oh,4
yea,4
i have like no readmes though lol,2
what if we’re all fucked,2
that would suck,2
uh oh :D,0
i mean,1
then we wouldnt be virgins,1
?,0
and would have to change the server name,1
oh i get it nvm,0
virgins + josh hg,4
are u guys gonna apply right away or get ur resumes looked at first,2
sorry why have i been summoned,6
interview,2
tips,2
also was it technical questions or nah,2
JASMINE HI,0
"i only got a few technical questions. most of the stuff was about personal experience, social skills, why you want to work with them etc",6
also hi,6
hiii jasmine !!!,4
it’s probably not going to be the exact same though since you guys now have a term of experience,6
hi,6
hi,2
i'ma send mine cooked and seasoned,4
hi,6
also uh oh,2
hi,4
idk how many technical things related to coop we'll learn in a term,4
i think the best piece of advice i was given was to sell your story. every experience you have can be phrased as a compelling story that will get people invested in your skills and you as a person,6
hi,6
true,4
human brains are wired to like stories for some reason,4
oh god i hope i don’t get asked to give them a time where i demonstrated interpersonal skills,2
"even if you don’t have a lot, being able to sell yourself will help set you apart",6
ty jasmine :D,0
u very wise,0
lol,4
another reason to have daily social interactions,4
JASMINE HOWS FIRST WEEK,7
lowkey boring. they said they would assign me to a project but they haven't yet and now one of my bosses is down with covid :/,6
be the boss,2
Oh shit,7
uh oh,0
i should preface that he was at home the whole time i was working so i and good and the people i've met recently are good,6
ah well i hope he’s okay,0
Yeah :((,7
"he seems alright, he was pretty blase about it",6
"but uhh on advice again, idk what else to give",6
how's bryan,4
have you met him yet,4
i bet there will be other resources for yall to look at,6
oh bryan's great,6
he's super nice,6
"he showed me around the office and everything, i sit right next to him",6
shoutout to bryan,2
"bryan's are great, they're always so smart",6
i've never met a dumb bryan before,6
what about brians,2
any dumb brians?,2
theyre generally pretty smart too,6
brian < bryan,4
all versions of bryan/brian seem very intelligent,6
even just aesthetically,4
the y really balances out the letters,4
thats actually a very good point,6
i never noticed that before,6
wow,2
EXCUSE me,2
SQL dumb thumbs_down,4
all of the jobs are up now on waterlooworks,1
also,1
are you guys doing cover letters for each job?,1
uh probably,0
boilerplate cover letters for jobs i don't really care about and then *nicely written* ones for jobs i do care about,0
damn,1
we rly got to get on the grind soon then eh,1
a lot of these are due in the next week,1
:_D,0
epic!,1
man how do you even write a good cover letter,1
why is math 135 really easy lol,3
math 135 difficulty is very deceptive,1
i kept going back to 145 bc i thought the entirre course is trivial,1
but it ramps up after the first midterm,1
"yeah, the beginning is like, introduction to using ur brain",1
i dont need to go past the beginning though lmao,3
just up to chapter 3,3
cuz i just want to make sure im writing proofs properly,3
wdym,1
ur gonna drop after ch 3?,1
im not taking it,3
oh,1
my 138 prof gave us the course notes,3
cuz we need to use proofs,3
but no one has taken 135,3
they just expect us to teach ourselves it lmao,3
"well, only if ur not in the math faculty",1
"also, id still recommend taking the course",1
there's a difference between knowing the structure of proofs and being pretty comfortable with non-trivial stuff,1
ik at least for me it was pretty helpful,1
i think most of the profs say its fine to not take it since you get a lot of practice in 136 lol,3
it's also just a pretty interesting course in general,1
number ttheory is cool,1
yeah maybe over summer idk,3
yeah im sure you'll be fine regardless,1
idk wtf im taking then lmao,3
ig it only makes sense to take it if u switch to the math faculty?,1
probably not worth if you have a bunch of other stuff you need to do as well,1
"but still, i thought i t was a cool course",1
number theory is rly rly cool,1
over summer im just gonna take whatever i want,3
cuz a lot of courses arent offered,3
if 135 is an option might just take that,3
could be fun,3
oh,1
yeah,1
cuz im *homeless*,3
that sounds nice,1
lol,1
sparkles,3
gonna take latin courses probably so i can be cool,3
@​MrDoga do you know where phys122 meet is,4
in the LEARN,3
this lecture sucks lmao,3
do something else during it,3
shes starting it in a minute,3
wait i know tyler and bryan are good at proofs,3
how do i write a geometric proof,3
do i have to get tedious and do formulas for relationships and stuff?,3
mmm,4
generally speaking geometric proofs aren't very rigorous,4
like idk how to give an example without just asking for an answer on an assignment LMAO,3
fuck thsi,5
fuck all,5
lemme think of a way to not get 71d,3
uni sucks,5
i think it would help a lot if you gave an example,4
yeah im thinking of one,3
for which course?,4
136,3
like if you have 2 vectors,3
and you take their dot product and its equal to the product of their magnitudes,3
and you are asked to find the projection of one of the vectors onto the other,3
"and they just say something like ""prove this is true""",3
its a very easy example to prove ofc its not like the assignment question,3
"but could i just say that since the first statement shows they have an angle of 0 between them the projection of ""v"" on ""w"" is just ""v""",3
"where ""v"" and ""w"" are the vectors cuz idk how to use the TeXit bot",3
hmmm so essentially the proof goes,4
v * w = |v||w|     =>     θ = 0 degrees     =>     proj_w(v) = v,4
you'd have to prove both implications,4
first one should be simple since v*w = |v||w|cosθ,4
second one seems doable too,4
ohhh ok,3
makes sense,3
slept through first lecture of the day,2
lets goo,3
starting 1B off right,2
new term new josh,3
$\land \lor$,4
well we have another 118 lecture in like 2 hours,0
shit,2
lmfao do you want my notes,0
it's not that bad you could probably read them and understand?,0
yes please,2
what do we have now materials?,2
yeee,0
uh idk why it exported like that,0
thank you folded_hands,2
lmaoo nw,0
uhh,2
its true shut,3
many things wrong,4
dont ask how but wolfram alpha agreed with me,3
$\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}a \\ b \\ c \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}a \\ 2b \\ c \end{bmatrix}$,1
ah yes ofc,1
is it a dot product tho isnt that a scalar,3
im making a joke,1
well matrix multiplication isn't any better,4
i think its just multiplying the components,3
idk what the notation for it is,3
but it works,3
for algebra,3
i think numpy.multiply is also element-wise multiplication,1
<:gigachad:854869870700658688>,3
ok time to learn the notation for it then so i can use it in my math proof,3
@​jahg901 @​g0at_fucker do you guys understand the tutorial qs LMAO,0
\circ or \odot,3
i’m pretending they don’t exist rn,2
LMFAO NO,7
"$\text{import numpy}\\\text{numpy.multiply}\left(\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}a\\b\\c\end{bmatrix}\right) = \begin{bmatrix}a \\ 2b \\ c \end{bmatrix}$",4
LOL,1
BRUHHHH idk what's happening,0
i think im gonna have to read thru the textbook or something,7
or search it up lol,7
smh,3
ok now its right,3
he just talks about fucking everything at once,7
i think u should use numpy array notation was well,1
oh wait forgot import,4
"[[1,2,1]]",1
or is it,1
bruh i dont rememebr,1
bruh literally,0
"np.array([[1,2,1]]) i'm p sure",4
oh ok,1
so ig i do remember correctly,1
if you want column vector specifically,4
$\odot$,3
LMAOOO,0
bro what are exam questions gonna be like....',7
ok it works,3
wait so pilots don't actually fly the plane clown_face,0
the fuck is this dude talking about,2
LMFAOOO,0
thats the symbol for rowbyrow multiplication,3
ok i have relearnt numpy notation,1
n nested arrays for n dimensions,1
"[[1,2] ,[3,4]]",1
2x2,1
isnt that just array notation for now,3
i really hate when questions are like “just attempt them for marks”,2
the arrays are nested,1
into n dimension,1
it’s just admitting they’re not gonna teach us enough to actually be expected to answer questions well,2
uw flow is scaring me LMAO,0
yea but numpy is when you use the numpy functions right?,3
our final exam is gonna be... *fun*,0
"```python
import numpy

array = [[2,3],[1,3]]

numpyArray = numpy.array(array)
```",3
no,1
i dont think?,1
it is an array representation,1
not an actual array,1
well you can create a 2d array without numpy being imported,3
but numpy makes it nicer to work with iirc,3
no,1
it works differently,1
numpy is vectorized,1
a lot mroe efficient,1
yea,3
but only the last statement is numpy,3
the array initialization is just an array,3
no like,1
numpy arrays arent arrays,1
ohhhh,3
we are arguing about different things lol,3
"but idk much about numpy i was just trying to clarify that the [[1,3],[4,2]] wasn't numpy",3
to my knowledge,3
hey still in the intro cool,2
that's insane,0
i feel like it's just going to get worse tho,0
WE JSUT STARTED CHAPTER 2?!,0
"[[1,3],[4,2]] is technically nested python arrays",4
numpy.array(),4
takes python arrays and makes numpy arrays out of them,4
ok this isn’t too bad,2
not rambling too much,2
@​jahg901 wanna go to dinner with me and luka pleading_face,3
also @​Chopin9938,3
and anyone else that wants to come,3
sure,2
yeah this is just chem,0
we also have like 5 min left,0
$(\overline{z_1z_2}) = (\overline{z_1})(\overline{z_2})$,4
wow,2
lmao quiz makes us use a formula we were never taught,2
yeah sure,1
:_D i don't want to look at the quiz,0
i need some time to mentally prepare,0
u get multiple attempts so it’s not bad,2
do you know what you get on each attempt?,0
i don't remember what he said,0
ya,2
and you also see which answers you get wrong,2
and the right answers,2
so,2
oh great,0
second attempt is pretty easy,2
time for 10 attempts :D,0
oh wait im dumb,3
@​TheSilican,1

have you guys started applying to jobs yet,4
when is round 1 deadline?,4
yeah we were talking about it,2
tyler’s done like 40 already,2
i only did like 25 or so,2
round 1 deadline is thursday i believe?,2
oh and tyler got called about an interview but it’s not until next week,2
wat already ??,4
deadline i meant,4
congrats tyler !!,4
uh they continuously update postings don't they? like aren't they always adding more?,0
YO TYLER GOOD JOB,0
maybe but it’s good to get in early regardless,2
true i went through a bunch of postings and then i refreshed and they added 200 more :_D,0
Thanks but I kinda expected it,1
Only Nvidia face_with_rolling_eyes,1

asdfsfsff still good job!,0
wait isn't that pretty good,4
"Thanks, ik",1
"I mean, it's not Google",1

tyler if you don't get google senior software eng i'm gonna be severely disappointed,4
LMAOOO,0
Maybe 2ed coop,1
nah,4
dang,0
high bar,0
Not rly,1
It's whatever,1
i wonder if anyone in CS is gonna get google,4
"how do you apply, do you just send resume?",4
"resume, cover letter, portfolio, link to website, all that",2
aww no cover letter,4
*fun*,0
those cheesecakes are actually so good,5
im glad to hear that luka,1
are u guys gonna attend engsoc resume critique,2
(those who can),2
when is it?,7
thursday at 6 according to the website,2
yeah ig ill go LOL,7
i did one in september and ehhhh they were okay lol,7
"the guy who critiqued mine was an ass, but not like the constructive criticism ass",7
was that engsoc or the standard one we got for cfe,2
im p sure was engsoc,7
"they make u make an account and submit into this like anonymous resume website?? and they just add comments
i also remembered that they took like a good week lol but i think they'll be fast with this one",7
oh was that one of the live sessions or was it just something u could submit anytime,2
submit any time,7
they just posted about it and like a google form or something,7
cuz this one has a zoom meeting so i’m thinking itll be different,2
"ohhh 
are they just gonna talk about it and give some advice?",7
like its not individual?,7
oh yeah i remember that that guy was an ass LMAO,0
i have no idea how this one is gonna work tho because it's a meet? they're probably gonna pair people up or smth,0
it says our application packages are looked at so i assume there’s some personalization yeah,2
fun :D,0
does the meeting also count cover letters?,7
i don't like how this guy rounds in between btw,0
*17* :_D,0
same,7
also why do so many uni profs like to write like multiple equal signs in a single line,7
man this guy is really boring lmfao,7
i like him,2
hes not like materials dude,2
true,7
that's when u send a very long email to ur hs calc teacher talking about how much u miss hs :D,0
i like him,0
like good pace it's just i don't like rounding halfway through,0
ig im just bored LMFAO,7
there’s so much school man,2
is the 140 tutorial mandatory?,2
i have no idea,0
i did assignment 0,0
is the tutorial even sync lol,7
there’s some folder that’s like “goals for mte140 tutorial/lab” or smth that opens 11:30,2
which makes it sound important,2
:(,0
i can't believe 140 is my least favourite course atm,0
6 hours of school lol,2
i really thought it'd be my favourite LMAO,0
i think it’s dry to begin with but it’ll pick up,2
cuz like we haven’t even done any algorithms or data structures yet,2
i think it's just teaching style,0
LMAO yeah,0
"if it wasnt async, i would like it better",7
she spent the first lecture talking about herself :_D,0
or at least a good chunk of it,0
actually fuck 111 though,2
did u take notes for that class yet,7
"i tried yesterday and gave up because he just keeps going
i dont even think he breathes",7
or smiles,7
i took really messy notes for lecture 2,2
but still retained basically nothing,2
he should just play guitar for every lecture,7
facts,2
y'all took notes?,0
i kinda just blankly stared at the lecture until i got distracted LOL,0
Tried to neutral_face  the notes do nothing lmfao it didnt help for the quiz or tutorials,7
are u guys taking notes here,2
yeah,0
i'm kinda just copying what he writes unless it's not important,0
yeah same,2

LMAO true,2
"@heredinner tmr, then co op?",1
also TIL the deans list is a thing,2
what is that,1
they put ppl with high marks on it or smth,2
oh,1
"""Each term, the top members of each class are recognized on the Term Dean's Honours list. This recognition is recorded on Quest as TDHL. To determine placement on the TDHL, for each student with a term decision (that is not a deferred decision) and a term average, the following calculation is performed: TermAverage -((Rank/CohortSize)*100). If the resulting value exceeds 80.0 then the student is on the TDHL.""",2
idk if this is recent or not,2

i think i did something,0
idk if it's right,0
whoa,2
send,2
yo wait,7
no it's not done,0
how did u approach it,7
did u assume that the charges like cancel out,7
did your method have anything to do with *cancelling* forces,0
bc,0
i didn’t want to assume they canceled so,2
pussy,7
is that why ur q2 is 12 pages long?,0
yeah pretty much lol,2
but they do cancel right?,0
like even if there were an odd number,0
or am i being dumb,0
ya i knew they canceled i just wanted to show it somewhat formally,2
gross,0
oks o they do cancel,7
my idea was take two vectors on the xy plane and show that the projection of the force on these vectors is 0,2
so if they’re non parallel the projection of the force on the xy plane is 0,2
i just drew a little circle,0
and wrote,0
'they cancel',0
let's hope they accept :D,0
i get the feeling they weren’t expecting a 6 page essay on why they cancel so you’re probably fine,2
it's fine they'll give you bonus marks :D,0
lol,2
+1 mark for wasting grader’s time,2
@​jahg901 did u also assume that the positive charges in q1 also cancel,7
with some explanation yeah,2
dang we really be cancelling everything,0
we’re like liberals in america,2
lol we rly did dot product in statics,2
lmfao yeah,0

"if a job says “ba/bs degree in engineering, computer science or related technical field or equivalent practical experience”",2
do they want someone who already got their degree?,2
doubt it,1
"since they also said ""or equivalent practical expereicne""",1
"if they are that strict abt having a completed degree, my guess is that they wouldnt add that in there",1
but like they want someone who’s got a lot of experience probably,2
enough to be considered equivalent to a whole ass degree,2
but also they hired a first year?,2
yeah but i would say still go for it if u feill out all the other qualificiations,7
"i thought standard procedure is if you have 75% of what they list, you are good",1
go for it girl,7
and it’s listed as junior / intermediate lol,2

i love the jobs where the required skills are like “self starter” and all that,2
those are my kinda jobs,2

you bet sis,2
it is first round,1
i feel like you probably want to aim a little higher,1
"from what ive heard, if you're smart, show you're rly interested and have drive, they are likely to take you over someone with more experuience",1
and you are kinda that person,1
i feel like you could get better jobs than you think,1
either that or im delusional abt this whole process,1
also possible :pain:,1
i feel like the jobs that are emphasizing more nonspecific skills are the jobs more likely to pull the trigger on that though,2
like,2
most of the jobs that list technical shit,2
i have maybe 1 or 2 of the required skills,2
oh,1

i don’t know lmao,2
i mean i don't really know how to explain it,0

friday fun sessions scared the crap out of me,2

@​TheSilican what are your thoughts on this u sub. lec,1
i'm doing 136 notes rn lol,4
oh,1
based,3
are you getting ahead in lin alg,1
already learned u-sub by myself,4
p much,4
the explanation is so sussy,1
"it's like, do this, it works",1
this prof is sussy,4
um smtg to do with chain rule,1
"ok, let's do it",1
it is just reverse chain rule,4
bruh,1
yeah ik,1
but it isnt explained in proof,1
¯\_(ツ)_/¯,4
tyler rn,2
idk use course notes lol,3
no like,1
treating differeatials as fractions,1
the course notes for 138 are goated btw,3
course notes are way better than prof,4
like what?,1
^^^^^^,4
I've been saying that all of last sem,4
they dont explain that there do they,1
theres a really good u sub example early on,3
ik i also read course notes sir,1
derivatives are fractions,2
MATH 135-138 have cracked notes,4
reading chem 123 course notes rn star-struck,3
bruih,1
yeah ok math overflow says it is a massive abuse of notation,1
actual bruhv,1
"135 -> 138 is like, ok let's learn proofs and some rigour, ok now let's forget everything we learnt last term and just do stuff",1
yea but it is really suggestive of some stuff,4
like chain rule,4
da/dc = da/db * db/dc,4
i think there was another math overflow post that i really liked,4
yeah it's great as a way to memorize rules,1
but it's also a massive abuse of notation,1
math notation just sucks in general,4
well maybe not sucks,4
but it isn't super great,4
"i dont mind it, i acc think it is good",1
@​jahg901 @​g0at_fucker we're literally talking about different types of wood HELP,0
"but if all we are taught is, just treat it like a fraction and go",1
it's so bad LMAO,0
asdasfaff,0
fair,4
"then like, is this even a math degree?",1
sounds fun!,2
lmfaoo nooo,0
"no shade to engineering, but i feel like math 138 is basically engineering",1
ayo,0
not saying it's a bad thing,1
look in general and tell me that's what ur doing in 138,0
"but like, why wouldnt we just do eng if wwe wanted to do this",1
*discussing different types of wood*,0
u guys already did integrals,1
we are only doing it this term,1
wait u haven't done integrals,0
yep,1
just started now,1
oh,0
well,0
we're also just starting lin alg,4
lmaoo,0
spent an entire course on basic number theory,1
then we proceed to undo all the rigour,1
i was supposed to be just starting them now :(,3
dr poulin did a bit of trolling in 137,3
he did integrals?,1
yea,3
didn't you take 137p,4
yeah its a 137p thing,3
they just add integrals at the end of the course,3
so ive done the first two assignments content for 138 already,3
we technically did antiderivatives briefly,4
in 137,4
no not antiderivatives that stuff was for like half a minuite,3
we werent allowed to use antiderivatives on tests either we had to prove reimann sums for all our stuff,3
LMFAO,7
Robert shows his wood,7

well you'll be fine,0
"i mean if they ask for them, should be fine",7
#manifesting for u,0
they dont** ask for them lol,7

if they don't ask they probably don't read them,0
the ones that did i’ll make one for,2
"yeah thats fine, they barely read them adfjadlk",7
did the jobs u guys applied to mostly have cover letter requirements?,2

i mean without cover letters applying is kind of a simple procedure,2
unless they haven’t even started looking,2
"in which case, they’re fucked",2
uh i think it's partly because they live in like vancouver/halifax/not here and they don't want to work far from home,0

wait yeah,0
man loudly_crying_face,2
after the first time someone did it again LMAO,0

oh ok yeah i saw that one,2
but like,2
come on man,2
that’s grade 10 shit,2
lmfao literally,0
is the number of constants always the same as the degree of the denominator,2
i think it should be right?,0
i think so,2

"""is it ok if i can pretend to know bc im p sure ik the material""",7
"SO OKAY MAN IF U KNOW THE NAME OF THE MATERIAL, SRESERACH AND FUCKING REFERENCE IT WHEN U TALK ABOUT IT",7

BRO AM I NOT EXPLAINING MYSELF CLEARLY IDK,7
oh what idk if it’s the same with calipers?,0
unless he’s using the end,0
like the depth stick part,0
without the actual depth stick idk,0
uh my group just guessed (w some research) for our materials and the instructions said that you can kinda do that?,0
like there’s some crap about using our engineering brains or smth,0
O_O,0
"yeah but he said he wanted to ""pretned"" to know the material??",7
"and all i said at the beginning is to make sure that if he does talk about it, its better to reference a source",7
i think it’s your fault,2
i think 4,6
and i submitted around 44 applications,6
4 interviews 1 offer is really good isn’t it,2
"i got one rank 1, 2 ranked, and 1 unranked",6
which is pretty good for a first year,6
how many people do they interview?,2
i’d think that’s like,2
VERY good for a first year,2
honestly tell him that he probably needs some sort of reasoning? don't u have to research the elastic modulus LOL,0
jasmine ur cracked :D,0
"it depended. some of them only 6, others up to 12",6
my graph for the lab looking kinda funky,0
y’all gotta keep in mind that a lot of this is luck and relatively low competition,6
well not really tbh,0
like ur competing with like 2nd year stream 8,0
you guys have more volume though,6
oh damn,1
that’s a big factor,6
lmao,2
4 interviews?,1
after writing cover letters for each?,1
we are doomered,1
fair but still idk,0
more volume wym,2
like there are more people you guys are competing with. both other program-wise and other school-wise,6
ah,2
right,2
shit,2
oh yeah that's true,0
bc,0
summer :D,0
still happy i chose stream 8 i think,2
idk how u wrote so many cover letters,1
a ton of my resume stuff is from 1A,2
im dying from them,1
lmfao i would have died if i was s4,0
mech stuff or just stuff?,0
"mech stuff, a couple projects, C++ knowledge",2
ah fair,0
time to go write 15 more cover letters :D,0
35/50 :_D,0
grinning_face,2
you are writing 50 cover letters??!?,1
me submitting 33 apps without cover letters,2
i am definitely fucked,2
yea cover letters were the worst part of the application process,6
50 in one day was not a good idea,0
cover letters aren’t everything,6
some of them i bullshitted tho,0
so,0
yeah,0
h-how,1
not everywhere really needs one,6
i just gave up,1
too much to do,1
not everywhere needs one but my ocd gets the best of me,0
"to keep track of where i applied i made this spreadsheet that's literally conditionally formatted to say ""do better"" if i don't make a cover letter",0
so,0
lmao,2
very healthy,2
i make spreadsheets for absolutely no reason it's very bad :D,0
did u put that on ur resume,2
excel?,0
no,0
L,2
well technically no,0
libresheets,1
i put it on my mech resume cuz some of them asked for it,2
i mean i have an ec that talks about using excel :D,0
so if they get that far they'll see it,0
hey that works,2
ehhh,0
excel is yucky,0
i also managed to use it for my 111 lab :D,0
sheesh,2
excel expert,2
bruh no,0
@​Chopin9938 turns out all AMD positions require cover letter frowning_face_with_open_mouth,4
my group liked robert's c++ program more than my *deflection calculator spreadsheet*,0
c++ star-struck,2
was his program just like,2
mte121 shit,2
yes,0
is it bad to submit a cover letter to a job that doesn't ask for it,4
"it also said ""have a nice day"" at the end LMAO",0
send code here and we’ll rip it apart,2
LMAO NO,0
that's so mean,0
i think this is what a bunch of ppl here did,2
(not me),2
mkay,4
i'm submitting one for everything lmao,0
but he’ll never know,2
damn,4

"didn't use it for all of them, only used it when i got lazy",0
it has stuff like this in it LMAO,0
mmm,4
well better than nothing i suppose,4
you know,2
i've heard it's best to keep it brief,4
you could write a c++ program for that,2
like 2 paragraphs max,4
mine's pretty short,0
it's like 2/3 of a page,0
they aren't going to read past that i think,0
LMAO to write cover letters?,0
honestly imo i just spent at most 20 min on each cover letter and then checked for grammar and then sent it,0
fill in the blanks,2
easy program to make,2
maybe,2
uh,0
depends,0
i feel like you'd have to do some web scraping,0
ohhh,2
i meant like,2
with c++ sounds like a bad idea LMAO,0
put in the thing you want to go there,2
unless,0
like,0
oh,0
lmao,2
then that would be like,0
alr,0
im not bryan,2
i just searched up web scraping with c++,0
it looks,0
horrendous,0
is web scraping just getting something from the web,2
yes?,0
damn idk how to do that,2
oh idk how to do that either lol,0
yessir!,1
oh that's smart,1
shahithyias thing,1

the c++ program?,0
you made a c++ program to make cover letters?,1
like some string sub thing,1
?,1
no i didn't,0
lmfao,0
this be a word doc,0
unless ur talking about the idea of making a program but like i feel like it'd be really bad in reality idk,0
i thoguht u just said u made a program to do that,1
oh lol should make an ai,1
that makes cover letters for you,1
big brain,1
"then put on ur resume, ""this resume and cover letter was generated by my ai""\",1
yooo,0
that'd acc be kinda cool LMAO,0
maybe ill do that next term,1
sounds like it might be a good gimick,1
it might be hit or miss with employers tho,0
but still pretty cool,0
true...,1
"but do u really wanna work for someone who thinks it's ""miss""",0
gotta ask urself these questions :D,0
too many questiosn to ask,1
too many cover letters to write,1
too many applications to send,1
too little time to do everything,1
I don't think AI is there yet,4
tyler can get it there :D,0
it is,1
i think there is a lot of overhype around ai,1
true,4
but it's also pretty cool stuff,1
also bryan when r u coming tmr,1
idk evening probably,4
ah alright,1

it doesnt carry over tho does it?,1
i thought it was 50/ round,1
"also, for multiple similar positions at the same company, shoud i make different cover letters for each",1
i thought get for 50 more,2
and idk it depends on if ur cover letter is position specific,2
well,1
id make it more general or specific depending on that right,1
i think it does carry over?,0
"because on the website it says smth like ""apply to 50 more""",0
no?,0
oh,0
uh,0
yeah,2
why does kanye west's ig only have 4 posts skull,0
and two of them are this weird monkey thing LMAO,0
oh i see,1

but like,0
too lazy to apply to 5 more,0
song is mid too,2

i'll listen to it on private session skull,0
it’s not like amazing terrible,2

Yup,2
i already downloaded the work history shit and whatever dsjfladksjal,7
what do i just submit???,7
i dont even think i uploaded all the files yetj adkfls,7

in documents,2
is it this thing,7
ya,2
ugh,7
merci de rein,7
what did uc all ur pacakge name lol,7
just ur name?,7
“i hope they can’t see this shit fuck cum”,2
charming,7
pretty sure they can’t see it,2
i made two packages and just called them “software” and “tron”,2
wait what abt if u want to add the cover letter,7
just make like,7
50 different packages??,7
there’s an option to make a custom package when u apply,2
i guess that’s where you’d do it,2
if you have a cover letter for every job then just make a custom package every time on the apply screen ig,2
aw,7
god damn it lmfao,7
rip,2
"wait @​Decaf Cheesecake , what was ur font size for ur cover letter LMAOO",7
is 11 okay jdklfasd,7
i mean i dont think it really matters,6
match it with your resume if youre really worried,6
@​Decaf Cheesecake how did u get co op first round,1
everyone ive asked got like no interviews,1
bruh,1
luck,6
it's really just luck,6
idk maybe its cuz i'm a girl and they need diversity points,6
"i hate to think that but that may have been a factor, as shitty as that is",6
or maybe,2
you worked your ass off,2
presented yourself very well,2
and made employers interested in you off of your own merits,2
bruuuh,1
i really think it's a lot of luck,6
and the extra curriculars i did in high school definitely helped,6
bruuuh,1
also speaking of diversity points,1
did any of u guys' applications ask abt race and seuxality?,1
no,2
i swear like half of mine has asked if im lgbtq,1
shit i’ll be gay if i gotta be,2
i guess if you added stuff that shows people skills and general stuffs tha tmight help you stand out,6
yes you can take that out of context,2
lol,1
i had a few of them ask,6
but not a ton,6
"but like, why?",1
idk it might be for grant money to pay you?,6
i feel like that's a claimed discrimination case waiting to happen,1
there's grants for that?,1
yeah i really don’t get that,2
just figure it out through the interview,2
i said im trans,1
i know some of them ask for canadian citizenship for grant money but its probably differnt,6
dont get job,1
ok discrimination,1
bruh feels like a walking lawsuit,1
yeah me too,1
i bet you could get more money out of a lawsuit than a coop term,2
just saying,2
i mean...,1
jasmine making 900 a week,1
that is 2 xboxs a week,1
think abt it that way,1
thats crazy,1
jasmine making 3rd coop term money lol,2
i just assume its for the employer to get an idea of the people they're hiring. it might not be for the best reasons but they *do* need a certain amount of diversity in the people they hire. or at least its expected that they will,6
i mean some of them just ask for weird things,6
"like if youre a female applicant, are you pregnant/a mother",6
i remember getting that once,6
bruh,1
that feels almost illegal to ask,1
ig it is kinda a grey line?,1
its a sucky question for sure,6
but it happens,6
the whole like private company rights vs. protect workers vs. other rights...,1
"it's not an uncommon question, at least for non-coop hires among women",6
some companies dont want people who will be in and out of their work because of bavbies,6
ig,1
man i just want a job,1
some of my cover letters are basically pelading for the job,1
"like ""omg ur company is so cool please hire me x3 nuzzles uwu -><-""",1
you just gotta lick some boots at first,6
be a suck up,6
it helps,6
this was the exact energy i had for every interview i got,6
"you just gotta be enthusiastic, even if youre not really",6
damn,1
just sell ur soul ig,1
thats what coops all about :),6
did u fix ur sleep schedule,1
wokring and all?,1
are you guys writing unique cover letters for every job,4

i mean expected,0
now we need the rest of them to watch atla LOL,0
"just to clarify, trig sub for integration doesnt have anything to do with chain rule right? moreover, it is making x in terms of some trig function of theta where theta is bounded so that the radical evaluates to a real, so that for any x you could of picked, trig func of bounded theta can yield that same x, and furthermore, the specific trig func which you subbed is picked so that the bounds of theta that make it an equivalent substitution, when using the pythagoran identiy, yield a value which can be simply reduced without absolute values (e.g root(sin^2(x))) =sin(x) where x is bounded between 0 and pi?",1
@​jahg901 is this true?,1
"im reading the textbook and this is what i took away from it, but im not sure if this is correct",1
@​TheSilican,1
any form of substitution is still kinda rooted in the chain rule,2
but yeah thats basically the point of trig sub to my knowledge,2
how does chain rule apply here tho,1
chain rule is what allows us to put x in terms of theta and dx in terms of d(theta),2
is that chain rule or just composition of functions,1
i feel like im missing smtg,1
it's the reverse of chain rule that allows us to work with certain compositions of functions,2
i get that with u-sub,1
"but in this particular instant, im thinking it more of like how sequence characterizations work",1
not sure what that is,2
im trying to word this is a coherent way as i logic it out in my head,1
"is the area under root(a^2 - x^2) = area under root(a^2 - a^2sin(theta)), where theta is bounded between -pi/2, pi/2, dependent on chain rule?",1
"it seems to me if the trig funciton of bounded theta can be mapped to every x is the original statement, it should be true regardless",1
OH,1
"when you take the integral, that would will in terms of dx, with the expression",1
with theta,1
ya,2
but to get dx -> dtheta,1
chain rule,1
sorta yeah,2
effectively,1
you can probably logic it out purely with the integral if u wanted,2
it uses the same principle chain rule uses,2
"mh,",1
m,1
thank,1
i just realized,1
chain rule is like a system of gears,1
K,4
???,0
i would say elaborate but my head hurts too much :D,0
"well, (dy/du)(du/dx)",1
is like how much y changes per u,1
times u changes per x,1
so you cna think of like gear ratios,1
and how they scale,1
Oh,4
That's actually pretty cool,4
not the gear ratios loudly_crying_face,0
Damn,4
tyler switch programs with me,0
you wanna be in cs gur,1
l,1

but like,0
apparently,0
"if u get like technical software qs during an interview, they're all from 140 skull",0
"also 140 has 3 grad tas + a weef ta, they literally have no reason to be bad",0

even if you get 100% it only adds 0.5% to ur final grade,0
lmao true,7
at least its just bonus lmao,7
but at this rate that 0.5 might make the difference bw passing and not passing loudly_crying_face,0
"i kinda fucked around with 140, got too used to the luxury of async sometimes but",7
I KNOW,7
LMAO i hate 140,0

"The three load-deflection curves of each ruler clearly show a linear line, which indicates that the deflection of beams is proportional to the load placed on them, and the material of beams will not affect this relationship.  

 

To measure the dimensions of the wood beam, a vernier caliper and an extra was used to get the height, width and thickness, which was the similar method used to get dimensions of other three beams. 

 

The formula of equation (3) defines that the deflection of beams  y=Fl^2/3EI, where F is the loads on beam, L, I are constant dimensions of the beam, and E is modules of elasticity. The formula shows that when the same beam is used in the experiment, the deflection of the beam is directly proportional to the loads put on it. Since all the resultant graphs show this relationship, equation (3) accurately predicted the behavior of beams. 

 

Even the beams are not perfectly rectangular in shape the experiment would still be successful. The shape of the polyethylene beam is a trapezoid but when the team approximated it to be a rectangle shape using thickness of its cross-section, good data were still collected and accurate result was calculated.",2
bro WHAT,2
oh hey twinsies,7
this looks...,7
who wrote this lmao,7
hao,2
"From table () and table (), it was found that the wood and polyethylene beams had the most accurate calculated Modulus of Elasticity(E), which were 0.003x10^10 Pa 0.033x10^9 Pa less compared to the published values respectively. Metal and wood beams had a relatively larger error when compared to the given E value, which were 0.20x10^11 Pa and 0.24x10^9 Pa smaller than the theoretical values respectively. It can be concluded that all the calculated E values were smaller than their theoretical values.",2
wood is in both...,2
man,2
"Wood generally has very anisotropic material properties which means it has the lowest strength when the load is applied perpendicular to it. Hence if a piece of wood cut with grains perpendicular to it, the wood beam would holds a much smaller load and its E value and strength will be smaller values, too.",2
yo what,7
you are going to get an 100 on this lab,7

no im confused,3
im just gonna send in my function and show the calculations that the problem doesnt make sense,3
and move on with my life,3
no i would recommend trying to prove it,1
cuz losing marks is sadge,1
i’m gonna go shopping tmrw,2
excited,2
i mean disproving is a proof,3
im just gonna email the prof about it,3
if they can clarify the wording in a way that makes the problem solvable then sure,3
no it is correct,1
the problem is solvable,1
well ok its solvable,3
but it takes assumptions that are dumb,3
because there are valid functions for which the statement does not hold,3
wait what exactly is your issue wityh the question,1
that its not true,3
it is,1
how,3
if the average value of the function is greater than the actual function,1
then the average of the function is decreasing as x increases,1
i literally already sent the example,3
the average value is decreasing,1
the average value of this function does not decrease over all x,3
if you are saying that the function must diverge to infinity then that is different is it not,3
your definition of decreasing is not correct,1
whats the definition then,3
spencer,5
doesn't that function increase and decrease,5
"in calc 1 the definition of decreasing was that for all x, f'(x) < 0",3
x1<x2 => f(x1)>f(x2),1
yes,3
that is what i am saying,3
not,1
<= 0,1
no,1
the statement is that the function must solely decrease,3
decreasing is f'(x)<=0,1
the question tells you that,5
doesn't it,5
isnt that not true for all values of x1 and x2,3
if you take x1 to be 1 and x2 to be 1.5,3
the interval is increasing,3
like if you mean that the function has to diverge to -infinity then that is different,3
no its the implication we have to prove,3
we have to prove that the function is always decreasing given certain criteria,3
but that function fits the criteria,3
it just isnt always decreasing,3
bruh,1
bro it literally isnt,3
it literally is,1
not only have i proven it,1
but so did the rest of the class,1
i know how to do it with the definitions lol,3
but it also just isnt true when you only define f(t) as continuous,3
like its not hard to just plug in the numbers for that function,3
spencer come up with proof,5
disproving the statement,5
wdym come up with a proof,3
i just posted the function,3
not some bullshit discord drawing,5
if for all functions the statement holds if i find 1 function where the statement does not hold then it is disproven,3
come up with a proof,5
disproving it,5
that is a proof,3
i just have to show there is a case where it doesnt work,3
plug in the numbers yourself,3
rigorous? is that better,5
it is rigorous lmfao,3
you are completely allowed to do that in your 135 class,3
ill just rewrite it tomorrow when i have time with a different definition of decreasing so it works,3
itll just be like *on average the function is decreasing*,3
instead of the function is decreasing,3
i think you might be tired,1
"no shade, but look at the question tmr",1
my proof is sound based upon the given assumptions,1
so i am confident that it is correct,1
yo what’s the question,2
does fav(x) > f(x) mean for all x?,2
"well, the question defines x>0",1
ok well yeah,2
"but like for all, not for some",2
what does that mean,1
"as in, it applies for an arbitrary x that meets a condition, not for any particular x we can find",2
"oh yeah, indeedly",1
yeah spencer trolling,2
sLencer,2
are u just doing math for fun skull,0
ya,2
gross,0
hey,2

"Solána Imani Rowe (born November 8, 1989), known professionally as SZA, is an American singer and songwriter. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, she began making music in the early 2010s, releasing two extended plays before signing with the hip hop record label Top Dawg Entertainment, through which she released Z, her third EP and first retail release.[3]

SZA's debut studio album, Ctrl (2017), was released to universal acclaim from music critics.[4] It debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, the album earned her four nominations, including Best New Artist. In 2020, it was placed on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. In August 2017, she was featured on Maroon 5's Top 10 hit single ""What Lovers Do"". The next year, she collaborated with Kendrick Lamar to create the top 10 single ""All the Stars"" for the Black Panther soundtrack; for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Original Song.[5] In 2020, she released the single ""Good Days""; the following year, saw the release of the singles ""I Hate U"", and Doja Cat's ""Kiss Me More"", which she was featured on, all three singles reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2021,[6][7] with the latter breaking the record for the longest-running all-female top 10 hit;[8] while she also earned an additional top 20 hit that year, as a featured artist on Summer Walker's ""No Love"", which peaked at number 13.[9]

SZA is a neo soul singer whose music has been described as alternative R&B with elements of soul, hip hop, minimalist R&B, indie rock, cloud rap, witch house, and chillwave.[10] SZA's lyrics are described as ""unravelling"", and her songs often revolve around themes of sexuality, nostalgia, and abandonment.[11] She has received 14 Grammy nominations, making her one of the artists with the most Grammy nominations without winning.",3

IT ALSO SHOWS THE DEPTH AND SADNESS IN AANGS CHARACTER BECAUSE HE IS THE LAST THING HE HAS FROM THE AIR NATION AND ITS NOT SUPERFICIAL LIKE AN ARTIFIFACT LIKE HIS STAFF OR EVEN HIS AIRBENDING

"IT SHOWS WHAT CAN MANIFEST FROM GREIF AND SADNESS AND THE LOSS OF A CLOSE FIGURE IN UR LIFE
AANG IS ANGRY AND IN THE EPSIODE HE CLEARLY SHOWS IT BY BEING AGGRESSIVE AND ISOLATED
WHEN HE FINALLY LOSES HIS SHIT AND FUCKS UP THE SAND DUDES DESPITE THE SAND DUDES BEING APOLOGETIC BUT HE DOESNT CARE
SO HE FINALLY LETS GO AND THIS IS WHERE WE SEE AANG CRY.
THINK ABOUT IT
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME (IM P SURE) AANG CRIED THRU OUT THE SERIES
AND TRULY SHOWS HIS GROWTH AND MATURITY FROM SEASON ONE BECAUSE SEASON ONE HE WAS KINDA LIKE A PLAYFUL KID, IT SHOWED MORE OF THAT SIDE OF HIM. BUT NOW, HES EXPEREINCE ANOTHER LOSS AND SO HES CRYING
AND DIGGING IT DEEPER FROM THAT FIRST POINT, HES WAS ANGRY AND AGGRESSIVE AN ENTIRE EPISODE, BUT THEN HE FINALLLY LETS GO AND CRIES IT OUT AND
AND 
HE CRIES IT OUT IN KATARAS ARMS
AND THAT SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF A GOOD SUPPORT SYSTEM
IT IS SUCH A GOOD DEPICTIN OF HOW PPL DEAL WITH GRIEF AND LOSS BECAUSE AT FIRST, IT GETS BOTTLED UP INSIDE BEFORE YOU FINALLY LET GO 
BECAUSE PPL DEAL WITH LOSS LIKE AANG, BUT
BUT
PPL ALSO DEAL WITH IT LIKE KATARA, WHO IS MORE MUTED AND IN THE HELP OF OTHERS",7

oh it is powder,0
theyre all just published online and theyre legit good,3
they just said her name,0
i will make league manifestos in maureen's style when you get further,3
oh,2
pouting_face,2
LMAO alrighty,0
you better break down every element of the complex symbolism,2
@​joshie woshie,3
they have full books pretty much,3
this has nothing to do with the show shahithya is watching but its cool,3
wow,2
too bad i don’t read books,2
fair enough,3
its not really a book its like 1000 words or smth,3
oh bruh that’s like,2
an essay,2
yea but theres like 500 of these,3
not counting each character has a biography,3
yeesh,2
league writer coop?,2
thatd be the coolest coop ngl,3
sadly they check your league account to see if youve been banned before <:CoolSunglasses:932719312521809951>,3
me and tyler cannot apply,3
actually neither can luka lol,3
YO,2
do they actually,2
yea its doomed,3
LMAO,2
bro,2
why u get banned,2
maybe not on a coop but actual staff have special tags if theyre employees at riot,3
i got very mad at my teammate cuz he was bad and also annoying,3
so we insulted each other a lot and both got banned :D,3
damn,2
hey why did luka get banned,2
none of us have said anything racist or anything tyler just afks games and me and luka get mad at people and call them idiots,3
luka same as me,3
white rage,2
tho i think luka was banned from playing for 2 weeks i only was not allowed to use chat,3
omg guess what came on my spotify,3
lol luka worse?,2
YO,2
luka told them to kill themselves iirc lmao,3
skull,2
i try to avoid bans when i get annoyed so ill just say really passive agressive stuff,3
"iirc i said ""idk how this guy got a job to pay for this account""",3
but like i think i just did it too often and got banned lol,3
its kinda low tier on league insults,3
gamer moment,2
there are a lot of people who are terrible humans on that game,3
bro how do i draw set symbols,3
like real numbers,3
just draw R with another line on the left,2
good enough,2
sheeeesh,2
the F is so bad lmfao,3
maybe extend the top of the horizontal lines,2

alright,0
episode 9,3
i'll keep watching,0
YO,2
LOL,3
JOKE BTW,3
oh,0
i guess shahithya doesnt play league so i should just not make any references even if the characters are in the game right,3
cuz a fair amount of the characters are just league champs,3
idk league,0
the one time i played it,0
was at like 4am,0
and i don't remember anything,0
you wouldnt recognize most of them so its fine,3
we should play sometime bestie!,1

wait ill find the kojima tweets cuz hes a good appeal to authority,3
see look kojima loves it,3
i have never played anything he's made but people like him B),3
what's with vander's accent lol,0
idk some of them have accents for no reason,3
doesnt make much sense but its cuz in league characters from the same area have very different accents cuz they make characters to represent groups of people,3
oh,0
fun ig?,0
like viktor is german for no reason,3
caitlyn is british,3
corki is american face_with_steam_from_nose,3
huh,0
viktor,0

i dont think viktor is common though its just quirky,3
who's viktor lmao,0
i was just naming people off the top of my head,3

"even then, a lot of ppl have them and dont care",1

scuse me,2
damn,1
are you calling me feminine,2
no i’m calling u a boy,0
but if i’m already a boy,2
saying i can get a kettle so i can be a boy doesn’t make sense,2
since i already am,2
all boys have kettles tho,0
therefore you’re wrong,2
no,0
don’t “therefore you’re wrong” me >:(,0
L sadly,2
"saying all boys that have kettles are bad boys would mean that all boys are bad, and then the badness would cancel out so then all boys with kettles are just boys",0
u just don’t have a kettle,0
u aren’t a boy :(,0
im so confused,3

"why do you switch between ur ""a""s",0
like u write them differently,0
good question,2
it just kinda happens,2
:/,0
how does that kinda happen?,0
"first ""a"" is so much more work to write and looks worse",0
"second ""a"" better",0
first a funnier,3
how lol,0
well which is closer to a,3
the second one makes no sense face_with_rolling_eyes,3
literally same shape,3
first a is like,2
boujee a,2
first a is what i wrote in elementary school,0
no,0
it's not,0
yeah it is,2
second a is basic,2
but like,2
sometimes i go for basic,2
sometimes i want to be extra yk,2
it switches like every other letter lol,0
i mean my handwriting is worse so i shouldn't complain lol,0
but,0
ur weird,0

and the & is just an 8,3
"and my ""h""s look like ""n""s",0
and i connect letters sometimes while writing it's really bad lol,0
"like ""realy""",0
wait is that your writing,3
isnt that fine,3
"that's my ""rewriting my assignments so they're legible"" writing",0
its still good handwriting lol,3
yeah but normal handwriting kinda,0
uh,0
bad,0
there is very clearly a sharp corner on the bottom right spencer,2
josh that looks like an 8,3
that does look like an 8,0
also stress looks like such a pain in the ass,3
bruh,2
like the unit,3
its physics right,3

materials itself is a pain in the ass,0

tron just too broke,2
tron is just too cracked,4
all the hiring managers,4

@​joshie woshie would u acc swithc into se,1
if job prospects a lot better,1
but se is cringe,4
ooh,4
cringe = basen't,4
or basedn't,4

damn tyler,4
oh sry,1
"idk how career prospects are in tron, cant be much worse than se right",1
"if it is, maybe switching if u can is smart, but i feel like it might just be hard now cuz mech kinda stuff?",1
i think experience is probably more important than program in any case,2
and yeah it’d definitely be a lost term to switch,2
i think the complexity and difficulty isn't worth the job prospect,4
like,4
"a good portion of the ""hirability"" of software engineering students",4
is literally just the name of the program,4
plus long term tron is probably a benefit if you wanna do like hardware / robotics stuff,4
nah se >> everything else,1
CS > every other program at waterloo > SE thinking_face,4

before i listened to drake :(,0
pleading_face,3
im pretty cool,3
do you listen to future,2
he's in my playlist,3
Awesome,2
you’re cool,2
he never explicitly said that he listened to him tho :/,0
"he's just ""in his playlist""",0
good point,2
spencer i don’t know if you’re cool or not,2
bestie r u cool,0
what’s your favourite drake feature,2
pleading_face,3
:o,0
ok i only have 2 future songs in my playlist lol,3
then you’re only 2 cool,2
out of 100,2
out of all my liked songs i only have 3 future songs,0
and they're technically not even his songs lol,0
oops,0
not even In Her Mouth?,2
no :(,0
wack,2
u wack,0
"i think its like a past, present, and some future",7
nope,2
because i listen to future,2
making me cool,2
yeah ur soooooooo cool,0
"you start with some like background about yourself, but obvi not a deep thing, probably like where ur interests began maybe??? like if its a software job, like when you started doing more software stuff or something ig",7
"and then you move to present, maybe mention program, any current project going on or very recent to add on to ur background info",7
"then future aspiration, im also guessing pretty brief, like what u hope to learn more of and what u prob want to fully do 
like if its a backend interview or something, you would be like u wanna learn more so u can do full stack someday or something lmao",7
but also idk LMAOO,7
"in jasmine's wise words, ""tell it like a story"" :)",0
this is all somewhere on the lines of something i heard on tiktok lol,7
just ask for a better question ngl,3
"like just say ""well what do you want to know""",3
cuz thats a shit question,3
that's such amazing advice bestie!,0
is that sarcasm O_O,3
i'm gonna use it for my first interview :D,0
is it idk,0
i'm not a very sarcastic person,0
i mean i feel like it just kinda is a bad question,3
i'm usually pretty straightforward,0
oh wait were u not joking lol,0
uh,2
i was asking you lol,3
i not know if that’s the best first impression lol,2
and now i'm asking u,0
"no like its actually a vague question you can just say ""well what do you want to know"" and sound happy saying it",3
doesnt come across as mean or anything,3
i was thinking briefly touch on present first before going into past?,2
because their intent behind the question is unclear,3
i guess?,0
prof fine as long as u connect it back,7
like what do they want to know about you lol,3
i’m thinking rn like,2
briefly present then past then present then future,2
but it's like a pretty common interview question and depending on the interviewer it might not come off the greatest,0
like even if u mean well,0
also how long do u think an answer should be i’m at around 2 minutes rn,2
"for me, i would go with past, present and then future so u can talk about present more",7
JOSH DID U GET AN INTERVIEW,7
yeah yesterday,2
and it’s tomorrow,2
woah what,7
2 days notice loudly_crying_face,2
OH WHAT GOOD JOB,0
yo,7

mech or software,0
djkekdjdjoaken,2
software,2
how long is ur interview??,7
half hour according to ww,2
and it’s over phone?,2
so,2
"i think 2 min might be long for a tell me about yourself, i would keep it under 1 min",0
oh?,0
fun,0
for present all i’m saying is like i’m a first year tron student,2
yeah,0
i feel like that’s a natural way to get into it,2
*like initially,2
and during the past present future part i talk about what i’m learning and the project i’m doing and stuff,2
"that sounds p good, i would say just keep it short",7
and like make sure everything's connected and flows and shit,7
"i would do ""i'm a first year tron, throw in a nice story about how you got into coding + why you love it, touch on a current project that you find interesting and use that as a transition into ""what u wanna do in the future""",0
idk if that'll flow as nicely as it does in my head,0
yeah i sorta have that form,2
what time is it?,7
2:00,2
gl!,3
thanks,2
they better not ask technical questions,2

@​joshie woshie,5

MY LOVE,5
how do I answer this,5
joshie,5
ooh,4
red_heart,5
135?,4
yes,5
ew ew ew,0
you guys already on divisibility?,4
nope,5
wait were you trying to cheat,3
wtf,3
"this guy hit me with the mobile ad ""bet you cant solve this""",3
spencer,5
you literally,5
could not,5
even if you wanted to,5
lets be real here,5
i mean i told you one thing,3
im in a league game,3
ooh can u do that pls,2
"a, b, c, d have to have a pair that shares an r value since there are only three distinct r values, so the difference between those will be divisible by 3",2
formalize that or some shit,2
unless it’s for an assignment,2
then forget what i said,2
instead of the difference,5
would sum also work,5
the sum of those,5
@​joshie woshie,5
no,2
why,5
if the sum of the remainders is a multiple of 3,5
isn't the whole equation also divisible by 3,5
what if the sum of remainders isn’t 3,2
then its not divisible by 3,5
yup,2
so instead of difference you could also use sum?,5
to prove the same thing,5
right?,5
"think of a case where the sum of remainders for a, b, c, d is never 3",2
@​joshie woshie  get in call,5
ff,5
took josh,5
10 seconds,5
to solve,5
I'm going to fucking drop out,5
and look down upon myself for the rest of my life,5

i paused a lot and stuff,2
Search then up,4
ya,2
lmao,2
did you search them up,1
LOL,3
no,2
LMAO,0
i stumbled over words a lot,2
was it mostly technical?,0
ya but like basic stuff,2
just choked lmao,2
eh it's okay we didn't like them anyways face_with_rolling_eyes,0
i got asked to swap two variables without using a third,2
oh what,0
(this probably wouldn't make u feel better) but i'd choke too :D,0
a+=b; b=a-b; a-=b;,2
but he said it would only work if we took absolute values of the numbers or smth?,2
but i don’t see why that’s the case,2
and i basically told him that lol,2
oh lmao,0
not in a mean way or anything i was just like,2
that kinda smart,1
“i don’t see why that wouldn’t work”,2
that's very smart lmao,0
it should work,0
maybe it was a TEST,2
good that you were honest tho. better than being a suck up,6
cuz like even if it wasn't the absolute values,0
no like it might have genuinely been a test lmao,0
yoooooo,2
he immediately said “well that’s enough for me” or smth and i got scared lmao,2
like just so you aren't blindly responding u know,0
those feel like pretty stupid questions tho,1
oh what LMAO,0
how is that useful,1
in any way,1
logic,2
i guess like,0
firefirefire,2
idk messes people up,6
quick thinking,0
how is that useful,1
for an application developer,1

sell bread,6
put it online,1
gg,1
lmao dang tyler skull,0
"i feel like when it comes to human taste buds, a human chef is better",1

i mean isn't it subjective,0
since the data you are traning on would be what the chef would say anyways,1
yeah exactly,1
"so you can never really ""perfect"" a recipe",0
subjective ml?,1
like wtf?,1
LMAO,0
"i dont want to sound like a baker but baking is surprisingly hard. not every recipe translates perfectly for every oven, stuff like that",6
automate baking,2
put chefs out of business,2
automation >:),0
we stan,0
idk they're in the past,6
you literally dont need ml for that,1
they never even got back to me about it,6
you can probably write a closed form function,1

given a recipe,1
"dealing with pressure, temp, etc",1

i really do not think i will cry,2

i dont know why shahithya thinks you're softer than me,3
ok face_with_rolling_eyes,0
lmao i don't think he'll cry,0
i probably will cry by the end,3
i wont cry during any episode with action though,3
so i think if i get near the end itll be smooth sailing,3
then last episode might be annoying,3
LMAO,0
honestly i think if u don't cry then josh probably won't cry either?,0
but like,0
no josh is much less likely to cry than me,3
he will just watch it,3
and laugh at every sad scene,3
YEAH LMAO,0
that's what i was thinking,0
lmfao,2
probably true,2
Josh when's the last time you cried,4
new bet: maureen buys josh mcdonalds if he doesn't laugh at the sad scenes,0
impossible challenge,3
i think it’s been 4 and a half years at this point,2

we should all watch it together then!,3
when josh gets there!,3
yoooo,2
LMAO NOOOOO,0
cuz none of us would cry its fine,3
it's not like that happened before or anything face_with_rolling_eyes,0
its only the hardest episode to get through because the voice actor is actually good for the scene no cap,3
everyone else is whining,3
LMAO,0
i don't think i can watch it with josh,0
he's gonna make some stupid joke LMAO,0
cmon bestie itd be fun!,3

mr berry can vouch,2
if i made stupid jokes originally maureen would have gotten mad at me,3
it’s great fun to watch smth sad with me,2
moonlight LOL,3
english berry?,0
ya,2
i think when they kiss is still like a top 10 funniest moment for me,2
everything about that was so perfect,2
i mean i usually make jokes while watching things,0
its a good comedy we should watch it tonight,3
but we were all muted on call,0
"because ""spencer needed to focus""",0
yea cuz maureen is a killjoy,3
LMAO,0
shoulda just let her leave lol,3
i bet maureen scream cries to atla unmuted,2
i asked apparently no,3
yeah she doesn't,0
i think unmuted makes it easier to not cry though,3
yeah,0
it does,0
:),0
so whenever you're at one of the episodes that i had a hard time with its a watchparty angle B),3
ok how about,2
watch muted,2
and we randomly have to unmute,2
and talk to one another,2
so if someone’s crying they get caught in the act,2
OH SHIT,3
lmaooo that's riskyyyyyy,0
THATS FUNNY BUT KINDA MESSED UP,3
i think we should do it,2

then i will put this matter to rest,2
yo guys,4

"don't ask ""when can i expect to hear back""",0
lmao,2
dont talk about money,7
really?,2
uh,0
i think u should ask about pay,2
not necessarily,0
yeah nah dont discuss salary,7
i wanna say,0
i wouldnt,7
depends,0
"""so when do i start""",4
how else would you know lol,2
uh,0
you gotta make a decision,2
maybe ask about their company,0
that's what i would do,0
shows interest,0
ask about who you're going to be working with,3
what the structure is,3
"""can you talk more about _________""",0
oh that's a good question,4
what you might do day to day,3
yea yea,4
ty,4
ask questionst hat they can talk for a while about,3
ask if theres cute girls working there,7
yeah lmao,0
don’t ask those kinda broad questions after they’ve already touched on them though,2
wait no,0
cuz then it sounds like you weren’t listening,2
ask if the boss is a hottie,7
i mean if they specify any of those beforehand you dont have to ask,3
but ask vague-ish stuff that gets them talking a lot,3
thinking_face,4
interviewers like the sound of their own voice,3
if you get them talking for a while theyll think you were so cool,3
LMAO,0
they love talking about themselves :),0
is ur interviewer a millenial,7
im not even joking its just the strat,3
no i agree lol,0
the cute girls one is funny too,3
wait how am i supposed to know,4
am i supposed to know,4
didnt u stalk ur employer on linkedin,7
s e a r c h    t h e m   u p,0
find out shit about them,7
see if their cute,7
ask them the questions,2
smiling_face_with_horns,2
ask them out,7
if so ask them what their plans are,3
okay im sorry im done lmao,7
ask what their fave memory of working at that company is,7
i would suggest u ask about covid protocols,2
*part instead of memory i would say,0
""" I see that the company had ___event, blah blah blah""",7
like how was it,7
or is it an annual thing,7
i feel like that could come off as not genuine,2
yea,4
i wouldn't ask them about an event,0
i'm not gonna ask any question i'm not genuinely interested in,4
i would ask about their company in general,0
like,4
like if there's something that they did that peaked ur interest,0
^,4
yea,4
is it a video call bryan,3
ask them to talk more about it,0
i'm trying to pop of with genine interest,4
because their company is legit really cool,4
yeah they can probably tell if the questions are forced/not,0
do a striptease during the call,2
then you can ask the person if they’re horny,2
face_with_rolling_eyes,4
that was not gonna be my suggestion,3
and it makes contextual sense,2
if its a video call take notes,3
got that from ur dad smh,2
^,4
yea it works,3
ive literally used it and been complimented specifically for taking notes,3
cuz you look pro,3
what about really frantically erasing,2
might seem frantic but idk,3
or writing in crayon!,2
yeah!,0
i’m gonna get a job grinning_face,2
i should take notes on my computer,4
with my really loud mechanical keyboard in the background,4
to let them know i'm a fancy cool developer with a mechanical keyboard,4
smiling_face_with_sunglasses,4
"uh they might not be able to tell if you're ""writing notes""",0
imagine not having a mechatronics keyboard face_with_rolling_eyes,2
i'm just gonna say,4
lmao they'll question u about ur switches,0
oooh,4
if they actually tho,4
we'll hire u if you use blue switches,0
like actually interested,4
apparently there was a person that alvan knows,4
in upper year,4
he just ranted about some video game mod he worked on to the interviewer,4
who was actually familiar with the mod,4
and he got hired,4
interview is a human process after all,4
i feel like a phone call was more impersonal,2
yeah i think my brother's friend talked about a tv show they liked during one of their interviews,0
and got the job lol,0
i rly didn’t get a sense of the guy except for someone who asked me questions,2
idk if it was because of that or not tho lmao,0
yeah i feel like it's harder to talk to people over the phone,0
esp if they're just throwing technical questions at you for half of it (you don't really pick up a vibe LOL),0
lol yea,4
it’s ok if they don’t rank me i’ll just show up at his house,2
it really sucks that you got so many technical questions josh,4
they were really simple technical questions lmao,2
lmao even then,0
“what’s the difference between a while loop and a for loop”,2
“what’s recursion”,2
but like still,0
did you have behavioural questions,4
wym,2
"i feel like whoever answered the technical questions ""the best"" would still not be the best candidate lol",0
"like ""tell me about yourself"" or ""talk about ur leadership experience"" qs",0
i think,0
oh,2
no i got none of those,2
and that’s what i prepared for lol,2
"and like ""what would u do in this situation""",0
oh,0
wait like none?,0
first question was “tell me about this company”,2
then it was about if i like web or desktop more or smth?,2
and then it was what i’m currently working on,2
and after that it was just him talking about the position and technical questions,2
tell me about this company :/,0
thats a pretty dumb question lol,3
yeah,0
honestly a good question imo,2
to see if we did research,2
"i would think a ""why do you wanna work here"" would suffice",0
like,0
no because good interviews will wait for you to ask a thoughtful question about the company,3
i guess,2
that shows you did research,3
you still touch on the company and u can tell if you did your research,0
straight up asking is like making it a pop quiz not a job interview,3
but u also connect back to why you would be a good fit,0
honestly it did feel like a quiz,2
yeah this interview sounded more like a quiz than like interview LMAO,0
what if i was being marked face_screaming_in_fear,2
not every interviewer is good though,3
especially at smaller companies,3
that is why i am saying get them talking,3
when you get asked shit questions try to steer the conversation in a place where you can better show why you should be working there,3
i’m not good at quickly coming up with questions,2
too much think,2
too little time,2
thats just a skill to learn then ig,3
lmao,0
quick thinking :D,0

I just joined,5
are we really going to have an exam on this stuff,5
dr mann ius based,3
I love him,3
shoulda seen yesterday it was so much worse,3
Looks like something that's going to fuck me up the ass,5
Why is he based,5
cuz he just goes overboard and makes it so hard to understand,3
but the course is set up so that we dont fail,3
How,5
Is it set up that way,5
the mark distributions,3
are really favorable for us,3
Spencer there is no way the course actually goes this deep,5
In exams,5
Right,5
idk,3
cant wait,3
did you do the mastering from yesterdayu,3
Maybe,5
ok well i think its gonna be around that difficulty,3
hopefully O_O,3
if they give me actually hard lorentz transforms then ima kill myself,3
Bro no way,5
Nuh uh,5
i felt so powerful when i got questions right tho,3
Spencer,5
The mastering physics questions,5
Do not go as in-depth as the lectures.,5
I seriously hope not,5
Also that last thing was actually really cool,5
The graph,5
entire course is cool,3
Seriously tho,5
Are you saying the mastering physics is as in-depth as the lectures @​Spence,5
for special relativity the lectures werent too bad,3
its just general,3
this shits hard,3
damn it feels good to be a gangsta,1
duuude,4
apparently 1password has like almost 100% Rust backend,4
i'm so excited,4
how was the interview?,1

"brother shortened it to shash when i was like 3, and then my whole family started calling me shash, and then jane came over to my house once in the fourth grade and she started calling me shash bc she heard my mom calling me shash, then everyone in my elementary school started calling me shash, then i got to high school and no one really called me shash except for a select few, but then for some reason in grade 12 it picked up a bit again, and then in university whenever i introduce myself it's just easier to go with shash but then sometimes for assignments they'll get confused bc then they'll be like, ""are u shahithya or shash"" and i won't know how to respond, long story short, 70% of people in my life call me shash while the other 25% call me shahithya and like 5% of people call me by my middle name but we don't disclose that.",0

@​Spence @​10k bounty on Spencer head do you guys know the difference between PHYS 233 and PHYS 234,4
nvm figured it out from math phys server,4
what terms are you guys taking PHYS 234,4
i think 2A,3
cuz thats the course that made yi drop out,3
oh damn lol,4
i don't think i'll be able to get to it until 3A,4
why is zukos dialogue so bad,2
so true,3
ayo bestie,0
zuko's great!,0
sorry bestie but his dialogue is kinda cheesy,3
it gets infinitely better in later season 3 tho,3
"||”Three years ago today I was banished. I lost it all. I want it back. I want the Avatar. I want my honour, my throne. I want my father not to think I’m worthless.”||",2
who the fuck just says this,2
especially to the only person they’ve been talking to for like years,2
hes just an angsty teen,7
haha relatable !,0
"also, hes just deep like that",7
soooo deep,2
how do i make myself memorable for an interview,7
im up against fucking 6 other people and only one of them are in first year and she seems cooler than me,7
LIKE,7
AND IM GOING FIRST,7
i’d suggest just being enthusiastic and coming prepared with knowledge of the company,2
i already studied pete davidson,7
i do have that like im putting on my white voice and i made notes on the cmopany lmaoo,7
but the thing is theyre all like second years and one of them literally had a software testing job,7
just be better than the stinky cs kids and u'll be fine,0
im obvi better than them,7
"i don’t think there’s really stuff you can “do” to get a leg up aside from being enthusiastic, prepared and showing them what u bring to the table",2
maybe this is why i’m not gonna get a job lol,2
that's literally what i told her,0
YEAH BUT THEYRE LIKE LITERALLY 3RD YEARS,7
"just present the ""best version of yourself""",0
okay,0
but like they chose u for a reason?,0
the best version of myself is during karaoke,7
"yeah, to SHIT on me",7
yeah because they wanted to waste 1/7 interview slots just to shit on someone?,0
YES,7
MAYBE THEY THINK IM WHITE BECAUSE OF THE NAME,7
what actually  is the difference,5
yeah after looking at that interview list i'm sure that's the case,0
"thats true, im p sure none of them are white",7
honestly,4
agreed,2
try to have fun,4
like legitamentally,4
not much,3
i guess it really depends on the vibe of the interviewer,4
but 234 goes into other courses,3
yeah see what the vibes are like,0
i mean she seems nice and she worked for makeup companies,7
~~*ask them what their favourite mario kart character is*~~,0
maybe thats another reason because i put like fashion and design interests in my interests section,7
LMAO,7
also the companys seems really chill lmao apparently they play mario kart togteher,7
but idk,7
"if it isn't toad, hit them with a not interested",0
u deserve better :D,0
oooh nice,4
yea if the interviewer is chill,4
try to vibe with them,4
remember interview is ultimately just a conversation,4
<:saddrake:933958016749928488>,2
me when interview is a quiz over the phone,2
that's true i would just pick up what the vibe is and just go with it,0
the company seems pre chill tho,0
so,0
"yeah like i have no problem talking to new people, i dont think im an awkard person",7
bbut literally ppl are 3rd year students like theyve had interview expereince before,7
and the other first year also had an internship before,7
also the company is tribalscale btw,7
ooh i applied to them,2
i mean,4
oh i got the QA one lol,7
if you're done your preparation,4
idk i don’t think u can crack an interview,2
its like debugging and shit and had less competition,7
there's nothing much else you can really do,4
just show them you,2
flash them,7
uh,4
don't do that,4
that would make you memorable,2
bro i shouldve bought myself a black tie,7
set the bar high bc ur going first,0
"at the end of the day they’re gonna decide who they think is the best fit and if they want someone with more experience, so be it",2
yeah that's true^,0
yea,4
if you're prepared and you've tried your best,4
there's nothing to worry about,4
ultimately i feel like the most u can do rn is just present the best version of urself,0
like u spent a good chunk of the weekend preparing,0
"if you get it, great, if you don't, that's not in your control",4
yeah,0
i spent the ENTIRE weekend preparing like kdsajflksdj im so behind on school again,7
but so did everyone else tbh we had like 2 weeks lol,7
LMAO,4
sammme,4
i spent like 2-3 days focusing only on interview,4
i did like no school work,4
sadge,4

coop grind More Important,2
<:sadge:783041382234849290>,3
i watched the lie detector test video again,7
i cant chew gum during the interview tho lmao but,7
i can do the smirk and the,7
special giggle,7
the gum thing was eh,0
NO IT WASNT IT WAS LITERALLY LIKE WOWW,7
ehhhhhhhhh,0
its a smart tactic,7
u should speak at length about pete davidson during the interview,2
Uhh don't do that,4
Uh,4
"yeah, WOWW",7
that pic is def memorable,7
family gcs are fun,0
"""hot""",0

so i might actually end up pulling an all nighter whether i want to or not we'll see,3
ooh fun,2
just take Adderall at that point,5
its legal meth,5
same thign,5
O_O,3
I do not think I am going to take adderall,3
ur medication is similar to meth?,1
nice!,1
@​10k bounty on Spencer head,1
lol i can see u are listening to my spotify eyes,1
smtg similar to meth isnt worse than adderall?,1
name is similar,3
i am not doing meth wtf,3
ohhh name,1
i thought u meant molecularly,1
i mean similar name means similar structure,3
but similar structures can do opposite things,3
"well, generally similar structures => similar functionality",1
both are uppers for example,1
yea,3
this one doesnt get me high though sadly :(,3
stupid staggered release pills,3

@​g0at_fucker MAUREEN SUN,0
HOW WAS UR INTERVIEW,0
IT WASOKAY,7
bro,7
Fucking WaterlooWorks said that it's gonna be interviewed by one person,7
And three fucking ppl showed up lmao,7
??? LMAO,0
One of them was like asking behaveial question and the two others asked technical,7
"But the technical questions was like ""riddles""",7
Like it wasn't acc on coding and there were like 5 of them,7
"Like I got ""how to test a microwave"" shit that that",7
I did make a couple jokes and me and this one interviewer bonded over doc martens tho,7
"And at the end, they were talking abt company events and shit and one of them literally said BEER PONG",7
"And I just said ""I turn 19 in august btw for that beer pong thing""",7
Got a couple laughs,7
I also curled my hair and wore this cute ass blazer so I was cute as shit,7
My shitty camera also made my skin look clear so that's good lmfao,7
Oh and I wore heels,7
"Bc, of course face_with_rolling_eyes",7
Sounds like it went well that’s good!,3
I think it went okay I felt like some of my answers were long,7
Like it wasn't rambling,7
But it was a bit like nitty gritty for the technical questions like idk if they wanted detailed or general,7
But they were chill,7
"Everyone, hope for me that the other candidates are shitty face_blowing_a_kissface_blowing_a_kiss",7
CUTE,0
well ig now the hard part's over,0
BRUH skull,0
based,3
@​g0at_fucker congrats!,1
the jokes stuff in particular sounds rly good,1
might be able to charisma ur way into the job...,1
which is epic,1
i feel like a lot of cs-sy jobs have ppl not so charsimatic in interviews (probably myself included),1
so i think that will be a major advantage,1
what was the company again?,1
Thank u bottom bitch face_savoring_foodface_savoring_foodface_savoring_foodface_savoring_foodface_savoring_food,7
It's tribalscale for QA eng,7
yooo congratulations,2

They're on their lunch break rn tho,7
stinky cfm/cs kids,0
Bro I can play beer pong with millennials dude,7
hey,1
hey,4
hehe oops,0
i do think focusing on soft skills is a good idea tho,1
you could've been a stinky CS kid like us,4
"like, in all honestly, it's highly-unlikely ur gonna gap the turbo cracked kids in pure technical aptitutde, but you can definitely be a more likeable person/co-worker",1
if i got rejected from tron and mac eng then sure,0
BASED,2
"tbh from the vibe you were telling me about, it sounds like they want someone more chill than someone super super cracked?",0
yeah if the interview wasn’t too technical,2
LMFAO YO,7
"nah the technical parts were like ""riddles"" like THOSE questions",7
"Burning rope question, how do u test a microwave, testing app with there different phones and a log in page, how would u test it",7
Bro one of the interviewers put a fucking FILTER on their camera,7
Like that cartoon filter,7
lmao u gotta give them more context i think,0
And she was also in a straight up dark room skull,7
Omg shash her name was also Luna lol,7
what i thought it was 2 guys and that olivia girl,0
no two girls and then the dude,7
"""the dude""",0
the dude and luna were actually in the qa department and the other girl was like hr or something,7
"okay so the rope question was like you have two ropes and in total, they all finish burining in exactly one hour",7
"and u want to measure exactly 45 minutes by burning the rope
but you dont know what material the rope is so they can brun at different rates",7
"like one of them burns really quickly but then burns really slow, like how would u measure 45 minutes",7
i think i fucked up on that one a bit tho lmao like the answer for was way different then the one i guessed so whatever lmao,7
"those are the only ""technical questions""",7
oh also,7
fucking i requested to join the meeting like 5 minutes before the actual start time,7
"and idk if that fucked up my chances because it made me seem too ""eager""",7
i think you’re fine in that regard lol,2
but i did it because i was like oh like if in eed to test out the wifi or camera or something,7
theyre doing back to back tho like right at 10:45 theres another one,7
"idk whatever, i just hope that management girl like fucks up a bit LMFAOAFJLDKS",7
PFFFFFFFF ok,0

$$(a+b)^n = \sum_{m=0}^{n}\binom{n}{m}a^{n-m}b^{m}$$,1
@​10k bounty on Spencer head,1
",tex
suppose we are looking for $x^{17}$. Then, we find the $m$ which corresponds to a term of that power. \\
Note that the degree of the product is $n-m+2m=17$ in this instance, since $'b'=-5x^2$. It follows that, since $n=11$ is given, we have $11+m=17\implies m = 6$. The coefficient is then easily given by $(3)(-5)\binom{11}{6}$",1
Bought coffee @​caffeinated coffee,3
YOOO,0

WHAT THE FUCK,7
that's kinda shit of them,6
good luck tho,6
"check your spam maybe, it might have gone there",6
ITS NOT,7
BRO,7
IDK WHAT TO DO,7
is there an email listed as contact info?,6
try shooting them an email,6
it might be that they're sending out the invites a few minutes before the meeting so people aren't joining when theyre not supposed to,6
ITS JUST CHUB,7
MAYBE,7
I JUST SENT AN EMAIL,7
do you know anyone else who,6
NO,7
THEY DIDNT LEAVE A CONTACT,7
is their email listed anywhere,6
like when you did interview signups,6
their email migh be somewhere,6
other than website??? no ig,7
it was originally through ww right?,6
yeah,7
and did you have to dign up for interview slots,6
like tyhey never sent me any external link even when they told me about the interview,7
yeah like just thru ww,7
but thats it,7
so other people's email should be there,6
unless they had it set up different than mine,6
it might be worth sending them an email,6
just asking them what's happening,6
no thats it,7
they just said to email chiub,7
ceehub cant do anyhting when i have three minutes left,7
there's not much else that i can say other than try to stay calm,6
theyre sending out interview changes way too close to the actual interview,6
they must know that this will cause some issues so they may be a bit more forgiving,6
yeah,7
i still havnt gotten anythin g,7
i mean,7
its their problem lmfao,7

means matrix of mxm?,1
ya,2
is there a good reason not to define it,1
for non-sqquare matrices,1
a non square matrix can’t be multiplied by itself,2
rows and columns don’t line up,2
matrix multiplication for axb by cxd matrix,4
oh,1
is only defined if b=c,4
it's repeated matric mult,1

"my brother has odd taste in tv, but i put up with it so i can steal his netflix account",0
so,0
i never memorized personally,4
idk about that,0
lmfao i thought u were making a joke about our relationship or smth,2
if u were comfy with not using script,1
just bullet points,4

not necessarily,4
so doing that is good,1
ok fair enough,1
but like,1

more effort does not correlate to higher grades in english,4
like,4
i've literally had assignments,4
oh yeah grade 12 was no effort for me,0
oh damn that lowkey such an asset for u,1
where the first one i put super hard effort and editing & stuff,4
and did worse than when I literally just wrote stuff in one pass with barely any edits,4
¯\_(ツ)_/¯,4
"well tbf english is one of those things where if u arent good at it, it's hard to edit ur own writing",1
i mean dumb things like 'do i blink that much when i speak' or 'do i move around that much',0
bc it's more noticeable than u think,0
cuz u dont know what is good or not,1
idk it just felt really arbitrary,4
"honestly, u were sac pres, you should be good",1
maybe i'm just bad at english lmao,4
yea sac pres is pretty impressive,4
"no, i feel you man",1

piano x rap,4
suffering from success,1
"lowkey every english class, i'd kinda bomb the first essay just to see what the teacher's looking for and then work that into all my other essays later into the year",0
i don't think that's a good tactic tho LMAO,0
lmao bruh,2
hey it worked,0
i did okay in english,0
i've found that editing & word choice really isn't that useful,4

i feel like we really overestimated the difficulty of getting into uni,2
except the cs kids,2
oh definitely,6
i can’t believe this was one year ago LOL,0
sO mUch haS chaNgEd,0
damn i was living with my parents then,2

oh definitely,6
i cry more,6
yeah i think so,2
spencer's drinking coffee,6
damn,2
tyler is coding,6
i’m pretty much the same,0

we've just grown and evolved so much as people,6
actually no maybe not LOL,0
"i should probably preface that im joking, just in case",6
oh damn lmao,2
i mean,0
we’re a group of friends that hang out with people we went to hs with,0
what a nice way of saying we haven't grown from high school,6
hah this time last year i was scared of most of u,0
yeah this wasn’t really a friend group in hs was it,2
"dont say that, i feel like it gives them power",6
does it,0
the fact that i was scared of them but got to know them and am not scared of them anymore,0
i mean what scared? pfffff,0
we’re all soft little cream puffs on the inside smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes,2
ofc ofc,0
"deep down inside, yall are just softbois",6
skullskullskull,0

theyre the ones always joking about whos the femboy of the group,6
eh fair enough,0
we do that?,2
i remember that,6
"it's funny thinking of them as ""softbois"" tho",0
wait when lmao,2
idk i'm taking jasmine's word for it,0
home depot does “behaviour based” interviewing,2
uh oh,2
idk i just remember that it was joked about at least 3 times which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened 3 times,6
that'll work out in ur favour,0

non-trivial public tests,1
nice,1
ew marmoset,6
gross,6
dude this course is so dumb,1
they make the public cases,1
some obscure case that we arent even asked to do,1
in the problem specification,1
what course?,6
cs146,1
bleh,6
isn't it supposed to be testing really small stuff for public tests?,6
that's how it was for us last term,6
"just like making sure you had the right definitions for things, thjen the real tests were all for the release tokens",6
exactly,1
exactly....,1
that's the stupidity of this course,1
it is supposed to be trivial stuff,1
for public test,1
just to see if ur code works and stuff,1
not abt some obscure case that wasnt even in the problem specs,1
same stupid issue with the last couple assignments as well,1
L,4
2:13,2
i’m right,2
dang that sucks,6
works up to taking 8gb of ram on my computer big numbers,1
nice,1
but also,1
public test 0 failed?,1
bruh,1
Isn't that good tho,4
So that you don't waste release tokens,4
<:goose1:934150972794630265> <:goose2:934155939718762556> <:goose3:934156800775839795> <:goose4:938665351615496253> <:goose5:938666064420696065> <:goose6:938667008004866058>,4
well,1
id prefer the qquestion wasnt like that in the first place,1
"also, im ok with losing a release test for saving hours",1
over learning absolutely nothing,1
@​10k bounty on Spencer head have you watched minute physics before,4
Yes,5
I have,5
Also,5
I just drank a large Americano,5
And I'm still fucking tired,5
About to go to sleep,5
This shit does not work,5
Pog,4
Channel is so good,4
"just drink more, problem solved",6
agreed coffee's so good,0
especially when u drink a million cups a day!,0
it's great when you drink too much and start shaking uncontrollably while getting anxious over every little thing :),6
the crash afterwards is very nice too,6
uh,4
i'm not wrong,6
Sugar crashes are better,5
Because then you're forced to eat more sugar,5
To increase your blood sugar,5
So you stop shaking,5
i dont think ive ever had a sugar crash,6
You should try,5
It's fucking crazy,5
You start shaking because your blood sugar gets so low,5
watching rn,5
ooh which one,4
i don't remember well but he made a special relativity series,4
well phys124 is special relativity so I watch that,5
@​10k bounty on Spencer head we should watch movie at your place some time,4
star response gotta be two minutes???? huh,2
?,4
i am surprised that interview responses using the STAR method are expected to exceed two minutes in length,2
i think a proper response should be roughly 10-20 min in length,0
anything else is wrong,0
<:annoyeddrake:938688436204867595>,2
isnt it just to give you enough time to give all the required details? any shorter and you probably wont be able to get in all the required info,6
is this for home depot?,6
ya,2
"i mean, my stories are probably going to suck",2
so not that much info to give,2
why do you think your stories suck?,6
i mean any story is a good story if u tell it right,0
^ exactly,6
also i'm sure it won't be that bad,0
ALSO HI JASMINE,0
hi,6
i'm cold :(,0
then just get warmer,6
can't,0
mkv,0
try harder,6
anything's possible if you put your mind to it,6
true,0
or if you get a blanket,6
i'm already using a blanket + wearing a crap ton of layers,0
still cold,0
that's a you problem then,6
get a heating lamp,6

:P,0
birthday gift eyes,6
PFFFFFF,0
yo should i lie about having a conversation with my dad that made me change my outlook on things,2
that would be a good story,2
im going to give you some life advice: lying is not good for an interview,6
darn,2
very wise jasmine,0
i know,6
"im great, what can i say",6
wait this might be a dumb q but how would this even come up in an interview lol,0
if they ask me about teamwork or adjusting to a new role or smth i have a place to fit it in,2
uh what about basketball,0
can't u bring up some story,0
yeah that’s the place,2
"if it's not wholly a lie, it's not a bad thing. at the end of the day, theyre asking you to give them a story. there's no harm in telling that story with a few enhancements. not lies, but enhancements",6
the entire premise of the story is a bit of an enhancement tbh,2
yeah definitely embellish the shit out of your story,0
but don't *lie*,0
i mean you can talk about how you felt in the moment and how those feelings changed your outlook,6
its more dramatic than just telling the story while staying truthful,6
what if i write the entire dialogue,2
an intense teary back and forth,2
you should,0
eeeeeh maybe not,6
with a piano backing track,2
guaranteed offer,0
we can all form a woodwind quintet for u,0
missing a couple instruments + half of us are brass players + i haven't touched a clarinet in literal years (but i'm pretty good at the triangle!),0
it'll work,0
or you guys could dramatically reanact what josh is saying in the background as he tells it,6
ooh,2
ooh that's good,0
im full of great ideas,6
film it before hand and we can edit it,0
on imovie or smth,0
it'll work,0
green screen in the background,6
what if i just played it on my phone,2
“if you guys want to see what it looked like”,2
i get to be the main character,0
^josh's dad right?,0
what if you did it as a puppet show,6
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,0
LMAO,2
but like it’s super serious,2
i’m on the verge of tears moving the puppets around,2
just say that it will help you articulate your feelings,6
i think they'll give u bonus points for creativity,0
and rank u a 1,0
so true,2
"*""i think one of my greatest strengths are my communication skills""*",0
i'm well versed in all methods of communication,6
ok i’m going to say it happened but make the conversation part very brief,2
*i can clearly articulate my ideas through a variety of different methods*,0

that's fair,0
I think it works pretty well for me at least,4
i’m not good at talking,2
i need all the models i can get,2
uh,0
don't like,0
script ur answers,0
It's kind of like using rising action climax resolution pattern in storytelling,4
that's gonna make it worse,0
^^^,0
It gives your response structure,4
yeah it’s not like word for word or anything,2
but if i just try to go at it free form i’m gonna ramble or stall out,2
this might be a personal thing but i don't like *overpracticing*,0

cuz you have to specify it wasnt p71,3
"like if u were a tutor or something, thats more scalable",7
damn,2
shoulda asked for money,2
what kinda stuff did/would you guys say for communication questions,2
you should actually charge people for ur cheat sheets,7
i would give like a good overview answer of their questions and then into some details for the real important stuff,7
oh and give an example,7
sac lol,0
"even if it was in high school or something, or even like a hackathon",7
damn lmao,2
i mean,0
what ecs did you do in hs,0
or like stuff in general,0
"basketball, band, probably other thigns",0
draw on those,0
yeah,2
but like communication?,2
you can probably spin some story from band,0
"""i was section leader blah blah blah""",0
i had a job working with kids lol but i don’t think that’s the kinda communications they’re looking for,2
i wasn’t section leader lmao,2
i mean there's communication skills there,0
*lie*,0
bruh,2
bro the amount of fucking communication skills i needed when working with kids,0
there's def something there,0
oh i also have a work story for communication,0
*this one's kinda silly tho*,0
what is it,2
that's a story for another time,0
:D,0
i wouldn't actually use it LMAO,0
darn,2
ok i’ll probably talk about the job if i’m asked about communication then,2
ok u convinced me,2
but like take working with kids --> talk about attentive listening and good communication or smth,0
L,0
yeah i kinda want to talk about being straight with people too,2
like treating people with respect without sugarcoating shit,2
uhhhhhhhhhhhh,0
that might be either really good or really bad LMAO,0
why,2
it might be a bit too bare minimum,7
like just the respect part,7
@​Chopin9938 just had a weird thought,4
$$\lnot (A \implies B) \equiv (A \land \lnot B)$$,4
but that seems weird,4
but if like the main part is being honest with people and not just saying shit to make them feel good,2
i just don’t want to sound like i’m advocating for being an asshole lol,2
yeah but like i feel like you're drifting away from the point,0
you can still be honest but touch on other points,7
"If A is ""It is 2am"" and B is ""I am awake""",4
how would u use star and tie that back to having amazing communication skills,0
A => B is clearly false,4
but that means that it's always 2am and i am always asleep ??,4
like if i say kids responded really well to my advice and changed how they were acting or smth,2
^this sounds kinda harsh mb lol,0
"but how does that tie to the whole ""not sugarcoating things""",0
Oh wait nvm got it,4
i was mixing up quantifiers,4
"i mean it might just be me, but you also don't want to confuse them right?",0
Lol alright,1
Ur welcome for the help smiling_face,1
"i guess my main point would be that if i give them the respect they deserve by being honest with them and not jumping around criticism, they recognize that respect and take what i have to say to heart",2
"i mean to tie it to the whole star thing u can start with - problem: sugarcoating things bc you worked with kids and didn't want to hurt their feelings or smth  --> solution: figuring out an effective way to communicate, without sugarcoating or hurting their feelings",0
but explaining that might seem tricky,0
just don't seem like an asshole LMAO - you'll figure it out,0
well the context is like coaching kids in basketball so i think i could say the problem was like a kid who was kinda full of himself cuz he was better than most ppl,2
and that was actually sort of the case,2
"ok but like, some people might react to that story with ""but he's just a kid messing around""",0
you gotta be a little spicy,1
"this is loo, everyone be preparing what they think are ""good"" answers, you dont want to blend into the crowd",1
you do have to be spicy and stand out,0
but also,0
every answer might not work in every situation,0
"i think what josh has is fine, it's just the way he words it (which should also be fine LOL)",0
mhm,1
"i think what is colloquially ""good"" is not good, since everyone be doing it. even if it's just the way u word things, i think it is important",1
"""why will i remember you over all the other ppl i interviewed?""",1
i don’t really believe in like,2
wowing an interviewer like that,2
idk,2
at the end of the day selection for a job is a process people put time and effort into,2
"they’ll make an educated decision based on resumes, the vibe they get from a person, all that",2
i just think being authentic and letting them make the right decision is the way to go,2
i feel that being authentic is only good if you are unique to others,1
authentic is good bc they can tell when ur not being authentic,0
nah josh can be sociopath,1
"but with that being said, u shouldn't say smth really",0
eh,0
fake it till u make it,1
"like i get what you were trying to say above, but like an interviewer who's just met u might not",0
agreed lol,0
idk i just try to think in the perspective of the interviewer,1
like everyone they are interviewing,1
are academically-inclined kids at loo,1
they all probably give the same cookie-cutter responses,1
"after a bunch, all probably sounds the same",1
"same reason why for ivy league essays, they recommend avoiding what is ""good"", bc u dont stand out",1
they’re only interviewing like 6 people though,2
but still,0
they might be interviewing for other positions,0
"you want to be an actual person, not some product out of the co-op mill of uwaterloo",1
yeah but if i go into it thinking “i want to stand out” that’s not gonna come off like an actual person either,2
i don't think that's what tyler meant lol,0
i dont meant to that extent,1
i think it's more of a,0
draw on experiences that will set u apart,0
"i just mean you dont need to say things with so much intent of like, what's conventionally ""good""",1
don't give blanket responses to typical interview questions,0
mhm,1
"(like u have to to some degree, but like try to find a way to stand out if u can)",0
"we are all unique individuals, just let that show ig?",1
am i :_D,0
"i mean right now my aim is like, not trying to come off as stuck up / an asshole / etc",2
more than trying to conform,2
ofc!,1
don't conform,0
that's the opposite of what we just said LOL,0
yeah that’s what i’m saying,2
"my main goal in coming off “good” isn’t to conform to some standard, it’s just to avoid coming off as a jerk",2
and i don’t think i should compromise that lol,2
"i suppose if you're worried abt straddling that line, it's better to air on the side of caution",1
yeah,0
"that being said, if you can play with that line, even better",1
i mean i don't think being unique/authentic necessarily means 'playing with that line',0
lol the implication of that,1
being authentic comes off as egotistical?,1
"i mean, josh is the most beautiful and intelligence man i have ever met",1
joshler <3,0

oh the calc assignment due today?,1
gl,1
choosing money over friends face_with_steam_from_nose,4
YEAH I DIDNT WATCH LECTURES LMAO,3
I DONT KNOW WHAT THE FUCK T AND M APPROXIMATIONS ARE,3
THEY ARENT IN THE COURSE NOTES FUCK PHYSICS SECTIONS,3
THEY JUST ADD SHIT,3
switch to CS,4
switch to tron,0
wait isnt that the qquestion,1
where it asks u to put the integral,1
in the integral calculator,1
no?,3
did luka say that lol,3
thats not the question,3
some sort of approximation,1
its actually a derivatives question,3
pretty much 137,3
using software,1
its an approximation,3
they want us to use code and find when n=100000000,3
after we make the formula for the specific function we are given,3
to approximate an integral that we cannot calculate by normal means of substitution,3
i think it's easier if u just send the question,1
im curious,1
bro im doing it rn its due in half an hour loudly_crying_face,3
ill send it in a sec,3
alright thx,1
"just integrate e^(1/x) from [1,2]",3
idk if you can do it ui havent checked,3
but it works for any function that doesnt have a simple antiderivative im p sure,3
@​Spence learn sympy,4
lol thats what i told luka,1
bc u told me,1
sympy is pretty cracked,4
"```from sympy import var
from sympy import sympify
from sympy.utilities.lambdify import lambdify
#assume the function is integrable over [a,b] and valid
def approximate():
    x = var('x')
    f = lambdify(x, sympify(input(""give function\n"")))
    a = int(input(""give lower bound\n""))
    b = int(input(""give upper bound\n""))
    n = int(input(""give number of normal partitions\n""))
    deltax = (b-a)/n
    area = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        area += (f(a+ i*deltax) + f(a+ (i-1)*deltax)) * deltax / 2
    print(area)

approximate()```",1
sympy acc kinda cool,1
java better tbh,2
YEA,4
it's a pretty cracked symbolic computation engine,4
like you can do most math wolfram alpha stuff in sympy,4
i don't think you're really using sympy in that example lol,4
you're just using sympyify,4
well im just happy having smtg that can parse symbolic text,1
would rather not make a tokenazier and all that jaz,1
I'm stupid they said,1
who said you were stupid,4
Well,1
should've sold when it was going down,4
and bought at bottom,4
smh,4
Made fun of for saying to the moon,1

LMAO,3
pretty much a lotto,1
yooo,2
it really is lol,0
i feel like having a wide range of ECs is pretty useful tho,3
does he have any manly ECs,2
like sports,2
like outside of athletics im pretty sure he does everything,3
L,2
wait this guy have 99+ with good ECs?,4
he should be set wth,4
yea he carries us in latin tbh,3
i think he solo got 350 points during a trivia competition once,3
watch him get rejected skull,1
they should include a beep test in the waterloo application package,2
i had 97-98 average with so-so ECs,4
which is like double what josh ng ever got,3
wait he's going for CS?,4
yea,3
if he doesn't botch his AIF,4

i should dm those people with my euclid score,0
just for funsies,0
i mean,4
ooh what u get,2
just cuz they got 90+ on euclid,4
anything below <80 is bad,1
lmao,2
i don't remember i did eh tho,0
doesn't mean they have good marks/ECs,4
i could probably find it,0
p sure marks/ECs more important than euclid,4
over/under 65,2
kinda does for math faculty,1
good ecs are good contetsts,1
then again,4
not in person euclid,4
i feel like i *may* have gotten under 80?,0
you get big scholarship for them too,1
so the probably reduced weight,4
cuz cheating,4
DAMN,2
oh bro i was joking abt 80,1
i got below 80 on euclid,4
didn't you too,4
oh OKAY LMAO,0
we all got below 80 lol,2
i was like,0
wth,0
no i got like 90,1
billed_cap,4
bryan got highest,2
king bryan,2
yeah he did,1
no probably tyler tbh,4

oh really,4
tyler made arithmetic errors,2
and got trolled,2
even without them,1
i feel like bryan would have gotten higher,1
i mean,0
i kinda bs-ed it,0
arithmetic errors are still errors u made right,1
so,0
didn't we both finish 9a and then get stuck,4
like,4
the jump in difficulty,4
didn't even attempt the last question LMAO,0
i feel like most ppl were like that,1
>=9b kinda crazy,1
from 9a to 9b was crazy,4
i couldn’t do 8b,2
or like wrote something but like definitely did not make sense,0
L,4
and i forgot arithmetic series,2
oh LMAO i remember that,0
was 8b that weird permutation thing,1
so i was frantically trying to derive it and messing up lmao,2
we should compare CCC marks smiling_face_with_sunglasses,4
with like prime factorizations?,1
no 8b was the perfect square thing,2
i got 8a that was that,2
ohh,1
bryan i got 54 after the fact so L,2
the trick was rewriting factorial or smtg right?,1
and then u could factor,1
and bam,1
ya i was just big dumb,2
euclid or ccc?,4
ccc,2
oh btw for 8b,1
but like,2
54 on euclid?,0
no time limit lmao,2
oh nvm lol,0
oh lol,4
"after, ppl on the cs server were ranting abt how the answer was on math overflow",1
or smtg,1
damn,2
i got 1 point under honor roll pensive_face,4
but... h-how did they know,1
hmmmm,1
LLLLLLL,2
so close,4
that ccc score kinda tough,1
i did pretty good on euclid considering my infected gum exploded,2
pardon?,0
his infected gum exploded,4
pretty self explanatory tbh,2
man we should have grinded for euclid,1
excuses excuses,4
jk,4
no,2
that’s cringe,2
we got in,4
but they give scholarships,1
wdym,4
we could have gotten liek 10k at least,1
if we scored like 5 points more,1
so sad,1
*we?*,0
¯\_(ツ)_/¯,4
"i think josh,bryan, and i were like 70-80?",1
yuh,2
yea,4
i should probably find my score,0
i don't remember it,0
we were comfortably distinction though,2
average was like 54,2
what's 10k scholarship cutoff,4
i barely made distinction LOL,0
so,0
i think >80 pretty much guarantted it,1
:D,0
still,2
what was distinction,1
distinction is like top 25% lmao that’s very good,2
like 70?,1
i think i was like 3 pts above the cut off or something,0
67 i think?,2
it was like a high 60s,0
i did not get a mid 70s on euclid,0
the circles skull,0
trauma.,0

what if he just stopped trying after,0
he'd have to put in so little effort,4
to fail math 135,4
oh,0
i think i could do it :D,0
yea you could definitely pass math 135,4

you should just switch roommates with luka's roommate or something,4
i think me saying LMAO 700-something times is funnier,0
that is true,4
yo i hit 10000!,0
i win,0
:D,0
disproportionally high,4
one word:,7
cannibalism,7
that's kinda crazy,4
i don't think the original MDHS had anywhere as many messages,4
im not in the original mdhs one,0
that's probably why :D,0
true,4
i got the invite and ignored it :/,0
pouting_face,4

winking_face,4
giftee avoidance,2

do you know the whole story,4
so we’ll get maureen too cuz fuck it,2
waterloo takeover,2

oh yo it's SO QUIET,0
maureen isn't allowed in MDHS '03s unfortunately,4
LMAO,0
dont think so?,3
LMAO,0
underground,2
shahithya do you know the story of how the old mdhs server died,4
ouuu i can reveal all secrets,7
isnt it really boring lol,3
or insult people,7
no lmao,0
this guys gonna try and blame me again i stg,3
spencer did flappy bird,2
LMAO,2
LMAO HUH,0
wait thats literally not it tho,3
L,2
u guys r discrediting my work i spent like 5 hours after that remaking the server,3
it was deleted when camrons brother gave his account info to a scammer,3
LMAO WHAT,0
and he was the owner for some reason,3
yea so basically,4
bro why is it so SO QUIET,0
originally MDHS server was just for '03 giftiees,4
but then,4
over time,4
it died cuz camron added a million of his brother's friends,3
more and more '04s started joining,4
mdhs friend group is irreparably broken,2
and they just kinda messed with it,3
then there were a bunch of '06s,4
at some point it became really really big and bloated,4
ew 06s,0
and kind of uncomfortable,4
and then,4
for some reason,4
"one of the '06s sent an invite for a ""flappy bird bot""",4
to one of the MDHS mods,4
which one? i forget,2
id rather not eat aidan,1
some dumbo added it to the server,4
wait this is way earlier isnt it,3
acc,1
i cant,1
PFFFFFFF,0
unless hes a fish,1
the flappy bird thing happened like 2 months before the server got deleted,3
then maybe id reconsider,1
literally was solved within 2 hours,3
"spencer, this was a pivotal moment",2
and the bot deleted all the channels when it joined,4
it literally wasnt bro,3
it represented the departure from the past,2
camron gave owner to his brother,3
without askign anyone,3
anyways so,4
the old MDHS was gonner,4
and then his brother started fucking with the server and adding penises everywehre cuz he thought it was funny,3
so this is the new one?,0
ya,3
ya,2
so there are 2 new ones that rose from the ashes,4
sounds like the second floor of mkv,0
no underground was there a while ago,2
ok,4
underground was there since like the first 04,2
it was being used more than normal MDHS for a while at that point,2
MDHS '03s has been there since Grade 9,4
it was originally called MDHS Alt,4
underground was there because people thought tippo was gonna go mask off skull,3
i remember this,0
YO I REMEMBER THAT,2
we should say smth,0
i created it in case the original server got destroyed somehow,4
liven up the server,0
bc waterloo better,0
my original guess was that camron was gonna go crazy and delete the MDHS server and I had a backup ready,4
alt or underground,3
josh post a picture of ur nails,0
people talk in underground,3
i was partially right,4
there's a waterloo channel in MDHS alt,4
bro screw alt no one talks there,3
respond to my prompt smh,2
underground is where i talk to kairui star-struck,3
shahithya isn’t in underground yet i think,2
it's not alt any more it's '03s,4
wtf,3
true,4

@​Chopin9938 how many interviews are you up to now,4
7,1
no im just kidding,1
4,1
no more since positing 1,1
wait what,4
i thought you had at least like 5-6,4
niet,1
i have 4,1
and like 3 pre-interview,1
assessments or whatever,1
i would count those,4
did they get back to u or no?,2
but those didnt become interviews cuz,1
i bombed them :),1
ah,2
lol not a chance,1
bro on one,1
i gave up,1
i think they should count as half an interview,4
"and my feedback to the company was ""too hard""",1
lmao,4
LMAO,2
lol we really both misspelled lmao,4
LMAO,1
LAMO,4
look we are all shahothya now,1
damn,2
:_D,2
shaheetheeyea,4
:D,1
"would having a ""number of interviews"" leaderboard be toxic",4
yeah probably,1
a lil,2
lol,4
k maybe not a good idea then,4
u should make a bot,1
calling me out damn,2
linked to quest,1
that updates everyone,1
when u get a mark back,1
ok first of all,4
yooo,2
quest doesn't publish marks until end of term i'm pretty sure,4
maybe crowdmark ?,1
“it’s learn not quest” <:drakeangry:933958483143958538>,2
second of all i don't think quest has a public API,4
make one,2
third that's probably even more toxic than interview leaderboard,4
that's not how it works,4
convert the html to json and find it,2
i don't have access to quest stuff,4
"yes, i was being ironic",1
ah,4
good one !,4
imo comparing marks is less toxic than comparing coop success,2
not really,4
cuz coop stuff is a lot more urgent,2
like,4
we all know how many interviews each other has rn,4
having a leaderboard would just be writing it down,4
marks don’t actually matter,2
marks are more private i think,4
i agree with josh,1
but like marks basically don’t matter if ur passing,2
marks dont rly matter,1
yeah pretty much,1
eh fair,4
what's a leaderboard that we could have,4
that isn't toxic,4
id gladly post my crowdmark creds here,1
probably nothing lol,2
if i wasnt scared one of u guys are gonna unsubmit,1
last minute,1
comparing marks is still a little toxic,2
yea kinda,4
but not as much as comparing coop success,2
imo,2
yea true lol,4
sometimes ppl like,1
center their entire life value,1
off marks tho,1
yeah,2
what's gonna happen when you graduate tho,4
flushed_face,4
no value.,2
compare salary,1
oh shit,2
oh truuue,4
true lmfao,2
there's always a number,4
yea,1
to base your life success off of,4
damn,4
that's kinda sad tbh,4
just realized how lazy i have been,4
i've got like 3-4 assignments due this week,4
plus a midterm,4
compare number of songs in library to determine life value,2
@​Chopin9938,0

lmao,2
it was like 15 min of technical,1
then 5 mins of me asking questions,1
and she gave terse responses to them,1
but overall i think it went okay,1
not a disaster,1
she laughed quite a bit,1
but also we werent rly vibing,1
Was it HR or technical person,4

josh ignores us in class :(,0
he’s too cool for us >:(,0
lol,3
i mean he said he would,3

at least the people behind me and maureen,0
actually?,2
wack,2
so true,2
damn josh youre really peaking in uni,6

well there goes my popularity,2
lmao,2

lmao,2
i’m like the weeknd in 2011,2
people know of me but nobody knows who i am,2
^^^,0
i mean after ur questions in class i think people figured it out,0
true,2
because they were so smart,2
also because i said my name,2
"uh no bc u said ""hi i'm josh! (whatever ur q was)""",0
yeah,0
it was actually really funny,0
"also no, i asked my question THEN he asked my name",2
"caleb also called u ""legendary""",0
so,0
¯\_(ツ)_/¯,0
because math is more important than pleasantries,2
so true,3
oh yeah,0
"""and you are...""",0
i will never ask a question in calc,0
“jash?”,2
LMAO,0
nothing to do partying_face,2
@​caffeinated coffee gl sir,1
thank u sir !,0
it's over right?,1
how did it go,1
yeah,0
i think it went okay!,0
it was very QA-y so i had to bullshit a lot of answers but like it wasn’t too bullshitty,0
we kinda vibed it was a fun time,0
nice,1
im guessing u would take this one over postalgia then?,1
if i get it skull,0
i doubt i’ll get it,0
why doubt,1
if you vibed with the interviewers,1

LMAO :D,1

bruh,1
no it’s just like realistically,0
"stop saying ur dumb shash, ur far from it",6
it’ll be nice if i got it,0
but like,0
be realistic but not pessimistic,6
i’m pretty sure they’re interviewing quite a bit,0
this is being realistic,0
hold on,1
this is blackberry right,1
yeah,0
cracked job,1
even getting an interview is crazy,6
"blackberry, regardless of role, will look rly good on resume",1
yeah that’s why i applied to some rando position,0
"i mean at least you dont have to worry for too long, rankings will be out soon enough",6
just for sparklesfunsiessparkles,0
yeahhhh :D,0
3 days?,1
not even,1
thursday !,0
we should get dinner thursday night,1
to discuss ranking decisions,1
"even if that's, no ranking :)",1
"yall better keep me updated on rankings, i wanna know",6
thursday night is my procrastination night tho :(,0
but dinner with friends D:,6
but not doing work throughout the week and having to play catch up on thursday to meet friday deadlines D:,0
that's a you problem :(,6
fix urself,6
it is LMAO,0
I HAVE POOR TIME MANAGEMENT SKILLS,0
another you problem,6
hmm,1
i spend way too long on one assignment that i don’t have time for others :(,0
you'd have an entire josh to help tho,1
that's a good point,6
jahg901,1
i don’t wanna ask him for help,0
why not,6
we're all pals here,6
gotta girlboss my way through eng,0
that's stupid,6
also it’s not really difficulty of content,0
it’s more of like,0
oh all my test cases work for my coding assignment! but is the code efficient? maybe not let’s fix that,0
im gonna bimboify myself before the coop term ends and get other people to do everything for me,6
and then they don’t end up looking at the code skull,0
i think i’ve asked the guys for help a total of 4 times?,0
ask more,6
boys scary :(,0
dinner is only like an hour or 2 as well,1
whats the point of having smart friends if you cant use them to your advantage,6
i should preface that was a joke,6
truu ur friends with the jahg901,1
hmmm that’s what u said last time,0
i appreciate your friendships more than your brains,6
ok but this time we have school,1
"good point, i am in the josh hg's inner circle",6
i mean realistically i could probably finish early,0
i apparently am not cool enough :(,0
oh oh i should also mention that this was a joke,0
you guys could always do dinner on friday,6
and hold on telling each other the ranking situation,6
dang replacing our friday night dinners,0
its all about the suspense,6
im giving you something to do that's not school and not self destructive,6
"so i think you meant to say ""thank you""",6
talking about rankings could be self destructive,0
only if you skew it that way,6
it can also be a positive bonding moment between friends :),6
getting hit with them unranked skull,0
oh,0
that too,0
and then we give each other therapy,6
and console each other through tough times,6
trauma bonding <3,6
THERAPY FRIDAYS,0

YO COME TO 140,0
they actually get really mad if they find out you arent part of the class,3
YOU'LL LITERALLY EXPLODE,0
IF U THOUGHT 121 WAS BAD,0
ehdvoushvodshvdsouhfouh,0
whens ur physics stuff LOL,3

on my circuits unit this stuff is boring,3
thursday,2
10:30,2
Come to calc,7
hopefully no ta :(,0
also come to 140 that’s funny,2
arent you guys calc 3 rn LMAO,3

calc 2,0
spencer would explode,0
i think,0
but like you guys do the standard calc 3 stuff,3
cuz you kinda speed through a lot of math,3
i don't think so,0
didnt you do integrals in calc 1,3
"We're gonna be doing proof by induction and shit, that's prob p interesting",7
cuz we're better,0
is integration calc 2?,0
L,0
i dont think normal 137 did integrals at all,3
137P did some but no by parts or any techniques yk,3
actual L,0
ya u guys r better,3
i'm just kidding (i cannot math to save my life),0
haha classic self-deprecating shahithya!,2
have to do linear algebra tonight,3
hehe :D,0
gross yucky,0
then just do some more physics tomorrow and im done for the first half of the week,3
my lab is pretty myuch over,3
better ace,2
you should come for our 140 lecture,0
i suck at lin alg so far,3
and then leave halfway through,0

materials was better true,2
(maybe it's bc i'm paying attention),0

why did people find this assignment so easy and the last assignment so hard,2
wait till we get to NON LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES weary_face,0
bc they dropped the answer key lol,0
oh right,2
ta made a little oopsie!,0

also isn't this technically easier,0
like there's less to write,0
ig,2
and i think it's easier for people to understand conceptually,0
u know,0
with the plates and all,0
very true,2
i’m surprised people aren’t tripping out about circular array,2
they haven't gotten to that yet,0
oh right,2
also they dropped the answer key LOL,0
they did do that,2
what is circular array btw,3
"*i accidentally downloaded it thinking it was the assignment and saved it as a txt file, oops!*",0
normal array but u treat the first element as coming after the last one,2
how silly!,2
spinny,0
oh so the head follows the tail?,3
ooh i have a question acc,0
it’s an array,2
python does that as a base LOL,3
what's the point of a circular queue,0

i will never associate with them,2
phoebe put them on blast,0

its like our teams chats but irl,3
"yeah but online, u can mute the chat",0

like they said something about our 140 assignment,0
and about how it’s stupid that we’re implementing these data structures,0
bc there are libraries for them,0
lmao,2

and i kinda just tuned them out after,0
cute,6
they sound like fucking nerds,2

"MAYBE ITS TO SHOW THAT THE WAR IS SO FUCKED AND SO DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE WORLD THAT THE KIDS ARE SO TRAUMATIZED, AS WELL AS PERHAPS GENERATIONAL TRUAMA, AND THAT MAKES THEM EMOTIONALLY MATURE 
LIKE YOU GUYS HATE SO MUCH ON KATARA BUT DO U KNOW WHY PERHAPS? ACC NOT YET FIR JOSH BUT SHE GREW UP WITHOUT A MOM AND STUFF SO OFC SHES MOTHERLY NOW AND ITS INSANE HOW SHES LIKE THAT AND STILL CANONICALLY 14 BUT MAYBE THAT WAS ON PURPOSE 
IT COULD ALSO BE ONE OF THOSE PARTS WHERE TO REALLY DRILL INTO UR BRAIN THAT ALL THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING TO JUST SOME KIDS ITS THIS WHOLE BURDEN AND THIS WAS ESTABLISHED FROM THE BEGINNING HENCE THE ""IM JUST ONE KID""",7
AND,7
is avatar to maurren ditf to me?,1
oh my,1
oh i thought u were gonna say something about her upbringing lol,0
but this works too,0
"so what you’re saying is, forcing children to manage trauma and figure things out without loving, guiding figures is ultimately beneficial to their maturity and emotional development",2
and ALSO gives them nice tits,2
"OBVIOUSLY THAT DOESNT REALLY EXCUSE THE SEXUALIZATION OF YOUNG WOMEN IN TV SHOWS, IT IS A GENERAL PROBLEM 
AND ALTHOUGH IT IS TARGETED TOWARDS KIDS AND SO THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE ASSUMED SO SO RHEY JUST MADE THE KIDS THE SAME AGE BUT EITHER WAY IT PROMOTES UNHEALTHY STANDARDS EVEN FROM A YOUNG AGED AUDIENCE",7
yeah,2
NO I NEVER SAID IT WAS BENEFICIAL BUT ITS A WAY OF SHOWING THIS TOPIC IN THE SHOWS PREMISES,7
i think it’s time for the caps lock to come off,2
YOU WISH,7
we like all lowercase here :D,0
everyone should go to settings and disable auto-caps,0

so the kids act like adults who sometimes act like kids,2
phone lol,0

IT DID GAIN POPULARITY BUT NO IT WAS A P BIG SHOW,7
a bunch of kids first watched it on nick around 2006,0

NEW FANS BC OVBI,7
ALSO I SAW A COUPLE OF TIKTOKS OF LIKE YOUNG MILLENIALS DESCRIBING THEIR EXPEREINCES,7
yeah the whole wave happened during quarantine lol,0

Aw,1

people would get confused im sure,3
he looks wasian,2
u look wasian,0
but like,0

from the back i guess because people aren't really going to look at ur face,0
imo,3
yeah,0
I look waisain but my peepee look black you feel me homie?,1
spencer tryna colonize,2

He gets me,1
tyler u should listen to the song,0
bryan should listen to the song,2
wait are you calling urself gay or,3
Why is that gay,1
isnt the line elluding to a handjob lol,3
i think bryan would really appreciate the repeated refrain,2
Is it????,1
indian burn is the thing from elementary schools,3
Me listen now,1
its like rubbing,3
Yes,1
idk,3
But I thought it was like,1
From vagina,1
i think in the context of the song he’s just jerking off a lot,2
LOL,3
LMAO,0
Oh,1
oh wait no lol it’s sex,2
okok so tyler is safe then,3
"“i go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti”",2

Not as deep as I go,1
vouch,2
josh cheating on me loudly_crying_face,3
Wait,1

Trans women,1
sorry i thought it was an open relationship,2
The vagina they get,1
like my idol stephen curry,2
Is it,1
A pocket y'know,1
Wait but they can feel it,1
i wanna say ew,3
So can't be?,1
but now im curious too,3
i think you should ask a trans woman about their vagina,2
Yes smiling_face_with_hearts,1
@​10k bounty on Spencer head how is ur vagina,1
All clean?,1
actually if anyone was to become trans who is most likely,3
wow,2
of the guys here,3
is it luka,3
No,1
damn,2
He is the least,1
By far,1
ya ok,3
luka would internalize it,2
wait alvan wore a miniskirt in class,3
forgot,3
Can't see anyone here being trans gonna be real,1
yea its probably a bad question,3
too unlikely to happen,3
probably me tbh cuz u guys all seem scared of what ur family would think,2
Josh,1
No way,1
i mean sure ig,3
i feel like if any of u were trans u probably wouldn’t come out with it,2
maybe spencer would,2
i probably would if i actually had dysphoria cuz isnt that a really bad thing to have lol,3
i’ve heard,2
its not like being gay,3
u kinda have to come out id think,3
i imagine there are very strong forces on both sides,2
Dysphoria sounds awful man,1
especially if your family isn’t supportive,2
The face that it's constant,1
Is crazy,1
u aint gonna get any better until you start telling people tho,3
Even if they get surgery and stuff,1
Dysphoria probably still there right,1
At least some what,1
i think it depends person to person but yeah probably,3
still if ur dependent on ur family that’s extremely difficult to do,2
ya it is,3
It must be rly expensive too right,1
u don’t HAVE to change genitalia immediately,2
actually idk about that tbh,3
Not covered by ohip right,1
youd have to look it up,3
But if u have it,1
And u have strong dysphoria,1
from my understanding that’s pretty late in the process,2
The fact that it's there,1
Is probably aganozing no,1
idk,2
possibly,2
never had it but sounds sucky,3
5-60k?,1

and i was walking on my own and i saw that there was a wolf on the streets,2
so i cut through a house but there was an extremely fucked up house party and everyone was doing coke,2
and i couldn’t find the exit,2
but then i did and i kept running but i didn’t have my phone on me for some reason,2
and i reached a highway,2
and i was trying to run to the side of the highway to get away from the cars but i wasn’t moving,2
and i was about to get hit,2
but then it turned into a video game where my character got hit and it was game over,2
the end :),2
i smelled a very distinct smell when ppl were doing coke i wonder if that smell was anything like actual coke,2

they didnt even submit anything to waterlooworks,1
sus,4
oh it was outside of ww?,6
yea you gotta check your email for that,6
does it say the ranking deadline is later?,2
no should be today,4
for sure,4
it was in waterloo works,1
but they just didnt submit any rankings to them,1
probably wouldnt want to work for them anyways so it is ok,1
"well, there are still tons of opportunities in the next round, and any company would be lucky to have you tyler",6
it’s ok ex-bestie second round face_with_steam_from_nose,0
this sounds like pity lol,1
i need not pity,1
but thank you,1
i don’t think it’s pity,0
damn and here i was trying to be nice,6
i wasnt insulting or anything,1
"just, im ok",1
"the most annoying thing is that like, you need to do all the apps from feb 14-17",1
"which sucks cuz , midterm",1
yeah that’s true,0
oof yea that's rough,6
lol yea,4
honestly worst part isn't not getting a job,4
it's more we have to do the whole application process again pensive_face,4
indeed,1
yeah lol,0
also i think i might be in a bit of a pickle,1
i only have exp in ml stuff,1
but that's hard to get first year,1
"but also, im completly unqualified for anythingelser",1
welp,4
¯\_(ツ)_/¯,4
like i legit got 0 qa interviews,1
i'm definitely redoing my resume,4
is this the roadpath to microsoft explore?,1
wdym,1
what if u get the job sir,1
oh,4
i mean hypothetically if i didn't get the job,4
I got ranked right?,4
2 positions for 10 ppl,4
oh damn,1
that's pretty good odds then eh,1
not really ?,4
some people were probably unranked so your odds are better than 2 in 10,6
"well, the other ppl r turbo cracked right",1
only scenario where I get job,4
yeah exactly,1
"is they only gave out one ""1"" ranking",4
"and i got ""2"" ranking",4
they have unranked too bryan,1
bryan it’s not guaranteed those who get 1 and 2 take it,2
probable tho right?,0
not unless other people don't want this job,6
^,2
and yeah exactly,1
oh true,4
ur odds are better than you think,6
24 hours copium time,4
ok so,2
qbuild is 2 work terms,2
"if shahithya and maureen get job, am i going to be the only person without job?",1
sadge,1
with an academic term in between,2
rip you didn't look at it,6
no it’s fine,2
oh i thought you meant 8 month sorry,6
i just have to decide if it’s what i want,2
well that's a guarantee for next coop term,6
yeah and that’s like a ton of extra time for stuff in 2A,2
which is appealing,2
@​caffeinated coffee @​g0at_fucker did you guys get anything,4
but also idk what if i don’t like it,2
what do they do there?,6
2 jobs secured?,1
bro that would be epic,1

i think this has proved once and for all,4
midterm,1
jahg901 is the most cracked kid in waterloo,4
i don’t want to be that person but i might have been a diversity candidate,0
tbh,0
bro,1
ur brown,1
that isnt diversity in tech,1
and female,0
lmaoo,4
oh,1
i forgot abt that,1
LMAO,0
idk if this would be a good idea but you could take the midterm round to clean up your resume and cover letters then apply in the third round,6
female is certainly minority in tech,4
wait,4
oh crap!,1
i'm rootin for ya alvan,6
i only have 50 more jobs,1
lowkey i might rank postalgia a 5 and see where ww takes me,0
@​jaa min how is gender ratio at coop,4
this round,1
im one of 2 women on the tech team out of 8 ish,6
"that would be epic, cuz then u could join me in the application sturggle",1
shahithya you were not a diversity candidate,2
so not great but not bad,6
let fate decide face_with_steam_from_nose,0
i doubt there will be 50 jobs that you're dying to take,4
and not have enough,4
bro i need as many chances as i can have,1
i think there are 5 coop srtudents here and at the sister company and i'm the only girl they hired,6

the rich richmond hill parents that would give u free tim’s/starbucks gift cards,0
@​joshie woshie the meanie weenie you should set status to suffering from success reference,4
uh the pair of wasian twins yeah,0
oh wait i forgot about that,6
that's a perk,6
also i don’t think they wanted to blow up the school,0
i think they decided that just setting it on fire would suffice,0
ah i see that's a big difference,6
so,1
for altomaxx,1
do i assume i just didnt get the job,1
would it be bad to reach out to them?,1
wait what happens if you go to rankings page,4
they didnt submit any rankings,1
"the app status is ""interview complete""",1
hmm,4
try asking an upper year if that’s happened to them before?,2
yea ig it doesn't hurt to contact them,4
yeah i shall ask,1
@​jaa min \,1
worst case you don't get position right,4
what do u think,1
should i respond,4
sounds like a conflict of interests,4
you should lie,1
say u got ranked 1,2
bro i'll be stuck with a sketchy job tho,0
exactly!,1
postalgia sketchy?,2
yes,1
that's kinda douche-y,4
which is why,1
startup is cool though,2
you should,1
lots of stuff,2
join me,1
in applying :),1
*independence*,2
OH I DIDN'T TELL U ABOUT MY INTERVIEW,0
yeah u did,2
LMAO,0
oh i did,0
but,2
what’s a little fraud right :),2
maybe you can make the sharpie algorithm,2
i mean i'll be one of two full time employees,0
yo,0
postalgia seems sketch ...,4
what if i have to work with a cringe se kid,0
:(,0
it's a gamble,4
bc it's two openings,0
that's why i'm ranking them a 5,0
cuz there are quite a bit of openings next two rounds,4
living life on the edge,0
:D,0
oh nice,4
guys i think i have to ask a parent for advice,2
whatever happens happens,0

ur choice buddy,0
fuck,2
idk either,0
career oriented question?,4
do both your parents work?,4
dad,1
always dad,1
ur mum a cheater,1
BRUH skull,0

LOL,4
ask someone else's parents,0
you really do have this problem now do you,4
damn,4
massive flex,4
did they not have the pay posted on the posting,0
honestlyyy,0
"reasons to pick mom: my dad will tell me to call the ceo and demand $30/hr, my mom does finance things

reasons to pick dad: my mom will be very annoying when i tell her the news",2
nope,2
"bro i think u should choose home depot, orange is a very nice colour!",0
and i asked qbuild guy during interview and he said it was an hr thing,2
why don't u talk to both (separately),0
i could,2
but then both cons apply,2
just to get as much info as possible tho,0
and then use that to finalize what ur gonna do,0
i’m sorry for going on ab this if some of u guys are disappointed with rankings but like idk what to do,2
LMAO idc tbh idk about everyone else tho,0
that's not on you i don't think,4
ok what if my parent strategy is noah avoidance,2
why avoid ur brother?,0
idk it’s a way of deciding,2
brothers can surprisingly give good advice,0
*surprisingly*,0
uh,2
he’s been trying to get coop for like 3 years,2
also i don’t really talk to him,2
oh uh maybe then ask ur parents and then do whatever they say?,0
unless,0
they give u like polar opposite advice,0
lmao,2
but i don't think that'll happen,0
and if it does use ur best judgement,0
perhaps a good question would be,1
do you reasonably think you can get better than qbuild for 2ed co op,1
ok i asked dad,2
well,2
idk tbh,2
depends on qbuild,2
i do view the two term thing as a pro now though,2
wait did u call or text?,0
this seems like a call type of thing,0
texted asking for a call later,2
oh nice,0
is that for qbuild,0
yeah,2
i feel like qbuild is making a comeback,2
in my head,2
lmao it might have just been sus interviewer but they seem cool,0
idk what they do,0
but also i vibed with the home depot guy,2
yeah,2
bald home depot guy,0
was he bald,0
and home depot guy is my supervisor according to the posting,2
ya,2
oh yo that's pretty cool,0

LOL,0
no i mean that josh has feelings too,3
not only sarcasm,3
i mean yeah,0
i mean for the most part yeah,0
josh does the most trolling tho,3
serious josh is rare (not in a bad way) but like josh doesn't need to force himself to be serious when we hang out LOL,0
we like based josh and not based josh equally,0
yay,2
ya but u didnt think based josh existed,3

*he actually also interviewed for postalgia*,0
like a job cant legally bind u to do that,1
and i dont think ww can either,1

yo okay,7
i dont think its a good idea if u guys come to our lectures again,7
or not that many of you,7
like ngl everybody noticed,7
and its kinda awkward,7
"like unless you guys are all willing to sit like at THE BACK BACK, i dont think its a good idea",7
"and people who even sat like further noticed and idk, truthfully, for me, it felt embarassing",7
"like i get that u guys dont care and thats fine and obviously i cant tell u what to do, but idk it just doesnt seem like a good idea unless you guys are willing to sit far away",7
or like come back like in a while because this is only the first week lol,7
facts^^,5
lmao no im being serious,7
yea,4
seemed kind of sus,4
was fun while it lasted ig,4
"okay no im just honest because i guess its better to be clear: 
i dont feel comfortable with anybody joining the lec tomorrow 
at first i was okay with it, but then after the whole thing people started noticing it and then it got called out in the tron discord and shit and idk it just made me feel kind of embarrassed and like anxious and shit because everyone knew and it was like the 3rd day and no one has done it 
and it might not affect bryan or tyler or luka or spencer because u guys odnt have to go the same class everyday
and im not saying that because its like ""oh i have an image to keep up"" or some shit, its not like that
its just the fact that i just became uncomfortable with it 
so if anything, i guess ill set up my personal boundaries rn, i think that if u guys are to do it again or something, do it later and ill just personally wont be a part of it",7
oh my bad,2
yea that's perfectly fine i respect it,4
"thanks lol 
i shouldve said something earlier but i didnt know how to bring it up and make shit awkward so i just wanted to say something or else itll get dragged on",7
kinda bored so i made this,4

hirji-gliatis,4
pensive_face,4
i like my first name,4

bryan just has a brand,7
i have a first name for a last name,3
change ur last name to Gryffyn,2
"""the silican""",7
marshall spencer,4
could very well be a name,4
you know who has the best name,7
lebron james,7
so true,2
tyler kowoski,4
actually giannis antetokounmpo better,2
the best last name here,1
is cchen,1
it is,3
i'm actually quite proud of my online presence,4
i've put in lots of work to have consistent branding across all platforms,4
there are more marshall spencers than spencer marshalls,3
makes you special,4
uh explain,4
bryan bhen,2
if he affiliated with the Bloods gang,2
i think my list for best last name,4
chen,1

sukumar,2

suk-umar,1
sukumar isnt bad tbh,3
"Last name tier list
```
1. kowalski
2. mao
3. hirji-gliatis
4. susnjar
5. sun
6. sukumar
7. tom
8. marshall
9. chen
```",4
tom over sun is L,2
really sun is that low?,3
eh it's ok ig,4
switch susnjar and kowalski,2
kowalski is S tier last name,4
dude,2
SUSNJAR,2
lower on list because it's kinda hard to pronounce,4
only cuz he doesnt tell us ghow,3
L,2
it's funny,4
josh you are one of 2 people with your last name,4
its incomprehensibility is what makes it so good,2
that’s true,2
either last name seperately are already pretty uncommon,4
the more slavic the last name,1
the better the last name is,1
i actually met someone with last name Hirji in a muslim class in like grade 2,2
i think her first name might have been simmin too,2
wack,2
you ranked our last names LOLOL,0
i thought i'd be lower than 5,0
it should be below sun tbh,2
hmm yea,4
maybe sun sukumar tom,4
whoa aang,2
||we do a little sexual harassment do we now||,2

hyphen,0
i think hiriji-gliatis is kinda overrated tho,3

i might've ranked it above hirji-gliatis if i could pronounce it properly,4
chen pretty cool tbh,0

@​TheSilican,1
for utinder and explorehacks project,1
can u rename the repo to include the project name,1
@​jaa min,1
when u coming!,1
there was supposed to be a 10:40 bus but it never came so probably around 12:30 to 1,6
wait you’ll be here at 1 or you’re leaving at 1?,0
here at 1,6
alrighty :)))),0
ooh cool,1
i’ll let y’all know when i get there,6
Mmm I have very specific reasons for naming my repos after hackathon name and not name of project,4
I'd rather not change,4
Also renaming the repos would break a lot of links oh devpost and other places,4
ok,1
it's just that,1
i feel that if the project name isnt there,1
it's hard to know what project ur talking abt,1
when ppl look at it,1
You should link to the devpost not the GitHub,4
no like,1
if u look at someones github,1
looking at stuff,1
ppl wont know what is going on,1
Mmm I disagree,4
They'll see the name of the hackathon and know it's a hackathon project,4
If it's just the name of the project they won't know that it's a hackathon project,4
yeah,1
exactly,1
the fact it is a hackathon project isnt important,1
its what the project is itself,1
that is important,1
It's also a practical thing too,4
Usually when we start a hackathon we don't know what the name of the project is going to be,4
So I just name it after the hackathon and the year,4
Renaming github repositories can have a number of bad consiquences,4
It breaks a lot of links everywhere,4
Why do you need the name of the project visible in the URL anyways,4
it;s just so that it's visible in github,1
not critically important,1
just thought it may be better,1
Just woke up lol slept through my alarm,3

@​Chopin9938 did you finish the practice midterm already?,4
is that what u do?,0
of course,2
if so you're literally more prepared than me,4

@​Chopin9938 did you finish 136 practice midterm,4
yeah,1
yea you should be fine,4
you're more prepared than me at this point,4

maybe i should train aws instance,1

tyler has done more prep than me up to this point,4

cozy small business atmosphere weary_face,2
$18.35/hr,2
qbuild hitting me with the dead-on average salary,2
oh fuck,7
thats 5 cents more than me,7
oh i thought u were 18.50,2
wait,7
OHHH fuck i am,7
i thought i was 18.30,7
L for me,2
are u gonna ask for a raise,7
or ask for a raise later because ur gonna be working there again right?,7
yeah second term is 20.30,2
wowww,7
its literally the exact same as the average coop wage for waterloo eng,2
LMFAO,7
that's still pretty good,6
i wonder what home depot people get lol,2
plus you got job security,6
yeah,2
definitely not mad,2
dude home depot was bad,6
from what i remember,6
like 16 i think,6
oh shit,2
W me,2
or at least for whatever job i got interviewed for,6
ur gonna be making good money josh,6
its 9-6 with an hour of unpaid lunch,2
is that standard,2
uhhh it's different from what i have at least,6
"i'm 10-6 with paid lunch, but i dont have set lunch hours",6
just eat whenever and work once youre done,6
paid lunch sheeesh,2
do u get sick pay,2
cuz i dont lmao,2
uhh no i dont,6
and when i dont think i have set days off,6
Is $15 minimum wage?,4
yea i think so,6
ok i make like $11744 if i work every weekday,2
not bad,2
yo youre rich congrats,3
woohoo,2
don't forget ur tax deductions,6
oh fuck,2
taxes,2
how much are those,2
a lot lol,3
nice 5 thousand dollars josh <a:drake:933955792497938452>,3
i dont actually know tho look it uop,3
gotta deduct stuff,6
idk how they do it tho,6
but i got some stuff skimmed off the top :/,6
wack,2
it's based on the different expenses you have,6
like if you're under a certain wage they're going to tax you differently,6
and i think if you list your uni fees as an expense they reduce your deductions,6
ooh,2
i have resp money though is that gonna matter,2
there are like tax forms you gotta fill out,6
yea that will,6
resp counts as income,6
ok i am no longer left leaning,2
"so if resp + income from coop is over 15k or something, you gotta pay more i think",6
why tax my hard earned dollars,2
"idk though, i have a very rough idea of how it all works",6
i think they'll be giving a good amount of it back when the tax season(?) is over,6
we don't make enough to be taxed a whole lot,6
but i guess its still tax so it still sucks,6
tax sucks,2
ok cool,2
i better take home 10k,2
lol,3
@​TheSilican r u ready for 136,3
idk how to feel cuz i need to do other work rn as well lol,3

I will be sad,1
So much effort in ds side projects,1
To work in IT,1
Would be pain,1
you could work at aritzia,6
and get leather pants,6
mmm good enough i think,4
i'm more worried about physics tmr morning tbh,4
i got ghosted by dr cummings so i think im getting a 0 on the phys quiz or smth,3
yes switch to CS,4
FFF,4
literally never got a response to any email i sent about rescheduling,3
uh oh,4
i think the email is `phys122@uwaterloo.ca` or something,4
did you email that or dr cummings directly,4
i sent multiple emails :(,3
people in the mathphys server are saying they got ignored as well,3
uh ohhh,4
lmao,4
stalk her facebook and find her phone number,4
im sending 1 last email even though technically this one is past the time of rescheduling,3
but like ive sent 3 now,3
rip,4
well hey on the plus side,4
apparently this years midterm is a lot harder than other years?,3
you don't have to worry about the quiz anymore !,4
136?,4
like the course used to be a lot about calculations,3
136 ya,3
yoo,4
theres more proofs on this one than previous years apparently,3
just speedrung 136,4
it was usually the final exam that was really bad for people,3
finish before 8pm,4
then start physics quiz,4
flexed_biceps,4
based,3
honestly the practice midterm wasnt too bad,3
i think i can do well,3
honestly bring a laptop nearby the 136 exam room,4
LOL,3
if they don't respond,4
Wait thats kinda smart,3
literally do some physics quiz questions,4
like bring my bag and just leave it at the door,3
yea yea,4
so i have computer and papers,3
better than 0% lmao,4
and just do it at MC at an empty room right after,3
kinda scuffed but what can you do,4
probably wont have time tho,3
8:50?,3
when does the phys tests end,3
Either 9:15 or 9:30 I think,4
They give a little extra time to submit stuff,4
hmmm,3
so like do entire physics in half an hour?,3
thatd be so based if it wasnt impossible,3
also they dont let me leave the midterm room unless im done super early,3
maybe i could beg,3
Lmao,4
do u have two conflicting midterms,2
Spencer if you can pass both tests you're a true sigma,4
no a quiz during my midterm,3
L,2
and they have not emailed me back about rescheduling quiz,3
but they did bryan,3
boycott the quiz,2
im being discriminated,3
go to cummings house,2
i mean i can probably pass in half an hour,3
but id rather try to actually get a godo mark,3
Ironic,4
man,1
the midterm is literally in an hour and a half,1
still no motivation to study,1
well what is there to study,3
ive become bryan without the 1password :(,1
familiarization with theorems,1
probably,1
i think you should just do work for other classes if you have to,3
honestly,3
i dont,1
im litertally just playing around with aws,1
oh so youre just sitting around?,3
lol,3
based,3
unlucky,1

how is dis,1
please roast,1
and destroy,1
you were making 4k a year selling PCs?,2
insane,2
1. personally i would take out the phone number bc u dont want employers calling u out of nowhere,7
also itll make all ur contacts fit into one like for consistency reasons,7
"2. for the skills summary, i would prob take soft skills out of there and put languauges lower",7
and put up all ur technical languages above,7
"3. personally again, lmao, i put my education at the BOTTOM like the last section of my resume i think you should put more emphasis on ur technical skills and expereince",7
"as well, when u talk about coursera, instead of ""Neural Networks..."", stay consistent and start with like the verb rule like ""perfected..."" or ""learned..."" or something",7
i think those are actually the course names,2
or like,7
"""taken"" or something",7
oh wow thank you for all the feedback!,1
im not sure how it works lol,7
wait theres more,7
epic,1
similar advice for this,7
"For example, the last point",7
"start with a verb so like ""optimized hyperparameters locally to..."" blah blah blah",7
"as well that last point, you have like two separate points into one. idk if they relation to each other bc idk what that is lmfao but either choose one thats more important and elobroate on that in ur last point",7
"first point, no dates, you already have a date",7
also it looks like u can bold certain key points in line 1,7
"similar advice to the second point, like that first setence seems good, shows off ur technical skill but you have to elaborate and put some depth into it",7
"oh man, thank you for much feedback",1
i will process after midterm,1
cuz i have to get going,1
so im not ignoring it...,1
thanks!,1
oh fuck lmfao goodluck,7
i bet he’s gonna ignore it,2

appropriation,2
amon's name is clever tho i like it,3

Efuhsefhsifh,0

so that's fun,0
the entire class knew more about tech design than he did,4
~~my final project did not work but i still got 100 bc i lied on the report and he couldn't check my work~~,0
LMAO,2

~~aaran and i did the same thing and it seemed kinda sus~~,0
wait was that kairui,2
it was someone,2

it's because u had to have like a certain number of swing components or smth,0
"so like we were like ""oh let's make the snake a different colour!"" and all that and then our games were kinda similar LOL",0
oopsie!,2

hey i bet we’ll get to make fun applications for our Data Structures & Algorithms project!,2

oh sorry 22%,0
oh that’s like,2
only a bit more than a statics test lmao,2
yeah like 7% more,0
just a smidge :D,0
probably less % per minute,2
probably lol,0
oh what we have another bonus assignment coming up,0
we could get 101% in the course?!,0
*could*,0
yooooo,2
dead channel + nobody watches seinfeld,2

our power supply didn't work during our lab and 3 tas tried helping us and they couldn't fix it,0
and MIKE JUST STANDS THERE,0

45 min of my life i'll never get back pensive_face,0
f,2
my partner and i were losing all our voltage between V+ and V- of the op amp,2
and we spent like an hour and a half trying to figure out what was wrong,2
turns out a black bar on the resistor was actually blue,2
and that fixed the issue,2
LMAO,0
it’s not too bad,6
reading resistors is not fun,0
i can send you the bus route i used if you want?,6
~~that's why u read one resistor and then use the same type of resistor for ur whole circuit so all u have to worry about is matching the colours~~,0
what if we go bowling in loo?,0
it'll be sparkles quirky sparkles,0
i unfortunately cannot do that,6
awh man,0
i probably cannot either tbh,0
trueeee,2
woah that’s a lot of quirky,0
i’m like 40-ish% quirky !,0
oh fuck bowling sounds so fun bro,7
im staying in loo for reading week so ill see if i can also catch a bus lol,7

bro coop + midterms i'm gonna die,0
oh yeah coop,3
rip,3
yah LMAO,0
welp :_D,0
lol,4
kinda was tbh,4
lin alg is such a cool course,4
i think midterms are fun cuz who cares about the grades i just gotta survive,3
which i think ill do if i just study,3
it wasn't super hard either,4
yea i think it's important to remember,4
marks are an indicator of your understanding,4
if you understand the content marks will follow,4
haha,0
i think that was less so in high schooll,3
oh yeah for sure,0
but in uni you arent shooting for 90 averages lol,3
i mean i'm just looking to pass tbh,0
ya so just study,3
attend class,3
high school marks are an indicator of your understanding up to about 95%,4
youll be fin,3
then it's pedantics / teacher preferences / rng,4
uh,0
95% is kinda arbitrary,3
i guess?,0
that's my take on it at least,4
but i think in hs you can definitely get 100% average,3
i feel like a lot of tests in hs was like straight memorization,0
but fuck it whos gonna be trying that hard,3
which wasn't like truly understanding the content,0
not even,4
it's like,4
did you follow all the rules that ms ting likes,4
"like grade 11 chem, i pretty much memorized how brewin solved problems and followed his steps",0
yeah,0
that too grade 11/12 physics,0
i feel like it was a lot of memorization of steps and not like a complete understanding of why i was doing what i was doing,0
like obviously i had a vague understanding and i would ask questions if i was super super interested but i didn't care enough in hs to do so LOL,0
that sounds bad on my part LMAO,0
nah i think thats most people,3
it def is but like it's kinda sad,0
ig that's just grade inflation for u LMAO,0
no hs for us ever again :),2
marks just downhill from here :D,0
partying_face,2
partying_face,3

ya i have plans with thenugaa LMAO,0

"PFFF NOT ""THE JOSH HG"" SAYING THIS",0
the recorded lectures are horrible,2
YEAH LMAO,0
but that’s like 10:30 pfff,2
10:30 kinda early :(,0
i did not need to wake up as early as i did today,0
"i woke up for 140, but then decided i didn't want to go, but i was already awake so i just sat in bed, and then went to 118 and barely paid attention",0
not fun :(,0
damn,2
i think i might sleep thursday afternoon,2
so i have energy for the all nighter,2
and the friday,2
thursday as in today?,0
ya,2
shit,2
ok that’s fine,2
it’ll make the sleep come easier,2

tomorrow maybe,2
tmr as in thursday night? or friday night?,0
times are confusing :(,0
thursday night,2
ur wrong then LOL,0
it's tomorrow rn,0
OKAY SO BRYAN DIDNT END UP LIKING I T,7
but the substance of the all nighter will be from midnight to morning on friday,2
since that is usually when i sleep,2
hence,2
tomorrow,2
that makes no sense,0
but apparently we might race for 5k so,7
just accept the fact that ur wrong joshua,0
root for me,7
nope,2
L,2
it's ok even *you* make mistakes sometimes,0
that’s a lie,2
mhm,0

RIP UR DICK OFF,7
astonished_face,0
mhm,2
the first step of acceptance is denial,0
how about a 100m race first,2
to warm up,2
that,2
doesn’t make sense,2
makes 1000% sense,0
oh fuck,7
denial is the 0th step of acceptance,2
because it’s not acceptance,2
ill do it so u can gain confidence,7
hey i'm you!,0
i use logic that makes NO SENSE,0
or just focus on 100m and just time urself everytime,7
ooh that’s a good idea,2
~~pls don't pull up my 115 proofs~~,0
hey why am i slowing down???,2
tbh,7
i think you should warm up with a nice 10k run,0
i don’t know how to actually run long distance though,2
i ran around ring road a couple times and like,2
i was walking after five minutes lmfao,2
yeah but you love that burn rght?,7

flushed_face,2
race for 5k?,3

and then leave u in my dust in the final bit,2
"bro i like pain LMFAOO like when my face is really dry and i moisturize, it fucking burns but it burns so good because i can feel the product working like same as running",7
false,7
ayo?,0
i think it depends on the pain,2

no like,2
there’s good burn pain,2
like that burn in ur chest,7
and then there’s uh oh sharp pain,2
and losing ur vision,7
black spots,7
panting,7
yeah but like moisturizing ur face when it's dry and having it burn does not seem fun,0
"and like ur legs are a bit sore, but thats good, you know, ur lactic acid is coming thru",7
its not fun but like....i llike it like i can feel it working,7
it means its working,7
like scratching an itch,7
yeah i get that but like,2

for me lol,7
yeah no stomach cramps,7
but like,7
some pain,7
yeah,2
buff engineers,7
i don't think running gets u buff LOL,0
oh yeah long distance makes u very slender and slim lol,7

Master stew,7
<:drakethirsty:933959950546382868>,2
yo are we gonna do a thing today,2
i miss daddy stew :(,0
circuits kinda yucky sometimes btw,0
only bc,0
i have to switch to light mode on one note to take notes for that course pensive_face,0
sounds like a you problem,6
ITS NOT,0
hmm,6
sure,6
it’s actually so ugly,0
idk how people take notes on paper,0
drawing circuits,0
is acc so bad,0
some of us are just better man_shrugging,2
i think i did all my notes in light mode last term,6
helped me stay awake late at night,6
i did too,0
exporting my notes as pdfs is so bad now,0
that was the worst,6
one note kinda yucky,6
one note is very yucky for exporting notes,0
oh and like u can’t have dark mode on one note then light mode on word,0
so that’s a fun time too,0
that’s what i was wondering,0
yea that sounds like it sucks,6
yeah you can easily switch tho,0
but like,0
why,0
light mode looks so ugly,0
light mode is good for keeping you awake,6
and burning your eyes,6
oh light mode + funky highlighter colours is good,0
like i was falling asleep in circuits,0
and then THIS,0
SO BRIGHT,0
oh so when jasmine says light mode is good suddenly shes right,3
but im evil,3
because jasmine is always right,6
yes bestie,0
bestie i’ve always supported u :D,0
they should make medium mode,2
where everything is grey,2
this screenshot doesn’t do it justice it was like burning my eyes,0
dark mode better,0
my notes look so cool in dark mode !,0
show,2
which course :D,0
u should post notes in tron server,2
no,0
then u can be cool like me :),2
bc u can’t export in dark mode,0
so it’ll look ugly,0
like this is the notes from yesterday’s calc lec,0
darn,2
but they didn’t look like that when i sent them,0
bc onenote bad :(,0
also when u export on onenote it like makes the writing thicker? so everything looks all smudged and bad,0
ooh that looks so nice,3
YEAH,0
IT’S COLOURFUL,0
im gonna try getting better at making notes over reading week i think,3
i don’t think i take “good notes”,0
onenote just worse sadly,2
i kinda copy what’s on the board,0
copying the board isn’t bad tbh as long as u understand what u write,2
i only use it bc it’s synced to my loo onedrive so i have access to everything there,0
i guess but like beltaos also writes as if he’s speaking,0
just sync hundreds of pdfs of handwritten notes silly,2
PFFFF so much work,0
idk how u do it,0
yeah i haven’t held a real pencil in a while i think,0
a week,2
at most,2
i think apart from the statics test and the mock midterm,0
it’s been a couple months,0
wack,2
oh i also used a pen for the midterm,0
so yeah no no pencils :D,0
pens + lots of whiteout >,0
Co op?,1

pfft,2
an hour tops,2
HUH,0
WHAT KINDA COVER LETTERS U WRITING BUDDY,0
i didn’t get a single interview off a cover letter actually,2
we could just work on co op apps on the side,1
in like a different room or smtg,1
cuz i rly need to focus too,1
sure lmao we’ll ditch them >:),0
I wrote a cover letter for my interview,4
what time,0
Your mileage may vary,4
wtf lol,3
i have to do math still,3

i don't think i'd be a good older sibling,0
i'm kinda glad i'm the youngest,0
hah he wishes,0
"fs dude

LMAO :D,1
dude i’d give him the best advice,2
>:(,0
u kinda have older sibling energy tbh,0
u don't seem like a younger sibling,0
me?,2
awesome,2
what being the youngest is so much better,0
being youngest was cool when i could skate past family drama,2
but i could be emotionally supportive big homie,2
youngest siblings have like no expectations,0
which is great,0
hahahhahahahhahahahhahaa,2
also whenever u get in trouble u can always blame the oldest sibling somehow,0
if u really wanted to,0
how much “trouble” do you get into lmao,2
i don’t think i’ve actually gotten in trouble in like years,2
i mean,0
i have strict brown parents,0
i kinda get in trouble for everything,0
oh L,2
dont older siblings have more pressure or something,7
yeah,0
they do,0
like more expectations are put on them and shit,7
that’s uh,2
not my experience lol,2
why are you saying this,1
tyler,0
are u older or younger,0
older,1
wait actually,0
cuz mako said smth about looking out for his brother,2
and i was like,2
yo i could do that,2
i mean u can still be a younger sibling and look out for ur other siblings?,0
yeah but bolin looks out for him too,7
i look out for my sibling,0
despite being 7 years younger LOL,0
but i don’t rly like him so,2
ok but being an older sibling won't necessarily change that,0
nah,2
i bet id be close with a younger brother trust,2
what about an emotional younger brother lol,7
someone you can mentor,7
that’s weird as hell,2
LMAO IS IT?,7
unless i grow up with the guy yes,2
i mean i used to be like that and then for some reason 5ish years ago my brother and i got closer?,0
how is that weird?,0
doesnt have to be blood related,7
ya,0
like if the thing ur looking for is to like mentor and share advice with someone then yeah it could be someone younger that u care about,7
ok if i had a friend for like 10+ years or smth and it was like that then maybe,2
tyler lol,7
lmao,2
tyler little bro,2
tyler's older,0
true,2
spencer,0
tyler older bro,2
"personally, ive been talking to like an upper year tron for like the past year and he gives lots of advice and shit and its only been a year and he lowkey feels like an older brother",7
but also idk bc im an only child LMFAO,7
i feel like you'd give pretty good advice if you wanted to (but that's not an older sibling specific thing),0
wack,2
how is that wack,0
to maureen’s thing,2
yeah how is that wack,0
thank you tbh,7
"i dont think its wack, but if it is wack is prob necause it has been a full year lol",7
like he was the one who told me about tron,7
oh he ALSO has a twin LMFAOO,7
"from what you've told me, he does give pretty brotherly advice?",0
personally i couldn’t get that close with someone unless it’s been like near my entire life,2
fuck the twin see what happens,2
close enough to give them advice?,0
the twin is lowkey cuter ngl,7
LMAOOO,0
"yeah but if u want one 10 years from now, ur gonna have to start now",7
i mean i’m not like looking for one lol,2
a little late for that,2
it was just a thought?,7
you could give ur brother advice,0
idk what you'd tell him but you *could*,0
i don't think i've ever given my brother like genuine advice tho,0
we’re not close like that lol,2
it's kinda hard to do so as the younger sibling,0
give spencer advice,0
be his mentor,0
so true,3
spencer what do you need advice on,0
@​Spence do math homework,2
nooo,3
wow i feel so brotherly,2
you gotta,0
or just don't listen to him,0
but nah it’s not the same if u don’t like grow up with them and shit imo,2

i'm like the youngest in my entire extended family which kinda sucks,0
"thing is i already get like the expectations of an older child, but if i were actually oldest i’d get the respect too yk",2
oldest children are respected?,0
well like,2
i felt like i was treated kinda like the baby,2
i mean that's just being a younger sibling,0
yeah exactly,2
oh so you just wanna be,0
not a baby?,0
older sibling josh woulda got treated like a real person lol,2
i feel like i don't know enough about ur family/its dynamic to comment on that,0
but i used to hate being the baby so now i just ignore it LOL,0
OH WAIT NO,0

not quite the same lmao,2
josh u have co op,1
noah does not,1
pfff,0

i’d be so different if i were oldest child,2
yeah i feel like everyone would?,0
is it the respect thing?,7
like i kinda radiate younger sibling energy,0
*apparently*,0
cuz like highkey a big reason i checked out of my family is that i felt like i wasn’t really respected as a person in the family,2
yo older brother josh could have been sensitive,2
sensitive is weak,1
nah u don’t rly have energy either way imo,2
i feel like u could be sensitive if u wanna be?,0
maybe i just don’t know u,2
you are strong josh,1
real man,1
so true,2
but like i could be cares-about-family josh,2
what really,0

Their brief romance is interrupted when Guy is drafted to serve in the Algerian War.
