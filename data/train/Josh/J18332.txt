The three load-deflection curves of each ruler clearly show a linear line, which indicates that the deflection of beams is proportional to the load placed on them, and the material of beams will not affect this relationship.  

 

To measure the dimensions of the wood beam, a vernier caliper and an extra was used to get the height, width and thickness, which was the similar method used to get dimensions of other three beams. 

 

The formula of equation (3) defines that the deflection of beams  y=Fl^2/3EI, where F is the loads on beam, L, I are constant dimensions of the beam, and E is modules of elasticity. The formula shows that when the same beam is used in the experiment, the deflection of the beam is directly proportional to the loads put on it. Since all the resultant graphs show this relationship, equation (3) accurately predicted the behavior of beams. 

 

Even the beams are not perfectly rectangular in shape the experiment would still be successful. The shape of the polyethylene beam is a trapezoid but when the team approximated it to be a rectangle shape using thickness of its cross-section, good data were still collected and accurate result was calculated.
