"Each term, the top members of each class are recognized on the Term Dean's Honours list. This recognition is recorded on Quest as TDHL. To determine placement on the TDHL, for each student with a term decision (that is not a deferred decision) and a term average, the following calculation is performed: TermAverage -((Rank/CohortSize)*100). If the resulting value exceeds 80.0 then the student is on the TDHL."
