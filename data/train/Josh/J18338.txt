From table () and table (), it was found that the wood and polyethylene beams had the most accurate calculated Modulus of Elasticity(E), which were 0.003x10^10 Pa 0.033x10^9 Pa less compared to the published values respectively. Metal and wood beams had a relatively larger error when compared to the given E value, which were 0.20x10^11 Pa and 0.24x10^9 Pa smaller than the theoretical values respectively. It can be concluded that all the calculated E values were smaller than their theoretical values.
